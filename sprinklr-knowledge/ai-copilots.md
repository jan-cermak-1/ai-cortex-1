## What are AI Copilots?

AI Copilots provide **real-time guidance, insights, and assistance** across workflows to help teams work faster and more accurately. Unlike AI Agents (which act autonomously), Copilots work alongside humans — surfacing recommendations that humans then act on.

Sprinklr has five specialized copilots, each designed for a specific team's workflow:

---

## Marketing Copilot

**Target users:** Marketing Managers, Campaign Managers, Media Buyers, CMOs

**Core capabilities:**
- **Budget recommendations**: Analyze campaign performance data → recommend real-time budget shifts across channels
- **Campaign performance summaries**: Generate natural language summaries of campaign KPIs (reach, engagement, conversions, ROAS)
- **Anomaly explanation**: Detect performance drops or spikes → explain likely cause → suggest corrective actions
- **NL reporting Q&A**: Ask "Why did our CPM increase this week?" and get a direct answer with supporting data
- **Cross-channel optimization**: Compare paid performance across Meta, TikTok, LinkedIn, X → identify underperformers and budget opportunities

**Use case example:**
*CMO asks:* "How did our Q2 campaign perform vs. Q1?"  
*Marketing Copilot responds:* Structured summary with % changes, top/bottom performers, and 3 recommended actions for Q3.

## Service Copilot (Agent Copilot)

**Target users:** Customer Service Agents, Care Supervisors, Service Operations

**Core capabilities:**
- **Real-time next-best-action**: Suggests optimal response or resolution path based on case context, customer history, and product knowledge
- **Case summarization** ("Summarize case" button): Instantly generates 2-3 sentence summary of entire case history for agent onboarding or handoff
- **AI Reply Assistant**: Helps agents craft better responses
  - 6 actions: draft, rephrase, shorten, expand, change tone, translate
  - 4 tone options: professional, empathetic, direct, friendly
  - 30+ languages supported
- **Sentiment routing suggestions**: Flagging high-risk conversations for escalation
- **Knowledge base surfacing**: Automatically suggests relevant KB articles during live conversations
- **After-call wrap-up**: AI-generated case notes and resolution tags

**Use case example:**
*Agent receives complaint about damaged product.*  
*Service Copilot:* Surfaces warranty policy → suggests "replacement" as next-best-action → drafts empathetic response in customer's language → generates case summary for supervisor review.

**Real-world result (Paychex):**
> "We're not trained on social media. Our agents are thinking about it with a service mindset. Using Sprout's AI functionality to help rewrite responses makes them more personable." — Michelle Latoy, 24/7 Enterprise Manager

- **Engagement optimization**: Recommends best times, formats, and hashtags for content
- **Sentiment coaching**: Helps agents craft responses matched to detected sentiment in incoming messages
- **Content inspiration**: Surfaces high-performing content patterns from historical data
- **Competitive signals**: Flags when competitors gain traction on emerging topics

**Use case example:**

- **Report generation**: Generates narrative reports from listening/analytics data
- **Trend analysis**: Identifies patterns and emerging signals from social listening topics
- **Topic clustering**: Groups mentions by theme, sentiment, and source

**Use case example:**
*Strategy Director asks:* "Why did brand sentiment drop 12 points this month?"  
*Insights Copilot:* Identifies top contributing topics → links to specific content/events → provides competitive context → suggests 2 response strategies.

**Real-world result (Caesars Entertainment):**

## Copilot vs. Agent: Key Difference

| Feature | Copilot | Agent |
|---------|---------|-------|

## Emplifi Cortex parallels

Emplifi's Intelligence Box in Cortex functions like a hybrid between a copilot and an agent:
- **Copilot behavior**: Surfaces recommendations with checkboxes (human approves)
- **Agent behavior**: After approval, executes actions across modules

This is exactly the Sprinklr "co-pilot mode" stage on the deployment ladder — the right starting point for enterprise trust-building before moving to full autonomous execution.
