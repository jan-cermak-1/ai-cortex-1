## Key Insights for Emplifi / Cortex Positioning

**What Sprinklr does well (Emplifi should match or exceed):**
1. **AI+ Studio as unified governance layer** — one place to configure all AI, swap models, set guardrails, control access by role. Emplifi's Cortex could be positioned as the equivalent agentic layer.
2. **Model flexibility (BYOK/BYOM)** — supports OpenAI, Azure, Bedrock, Google, Anthropic, xAI, Adobe. Important for enterprise procurement requirements.
3. **Pervasive writing assistance** — available across every text entry point (publisher, care console, briefs). Emplifi has this in Publisher but could expand to Care.
4. **Insights Copilot with traceable sources** — NL queries with citations is a strong trust feature. Emplifi's Fuel/Cortex should do the same.
5. **Contact Driver Discovery** — automated intent discovery from conversations is powerful for bot teams. Emplifi Bot could add this.
6. **KB Gap Analysis** — AI finds what's missing from the KB using real conversations. Emplifi has KB but this AI layer is a gap.

**Where Emplifi can differentiate:**
1. **Cross-module agentic flows** — Sprinklr's AI is feature-level; Cortex executes multi-step workflows across Publisher + Care + Listening + Ratings simultaneously.
2. **eCommerce/UGC integration** — Sprinklr lacks native ratings, reviews, and UGC commerce features. Emplifi's Commerce Cloud is unique.
3. **Simplicity and time-to-value** — Sprinklr's AI requires significant configuration. Cortex proposes and executes with one click.
