## Key Sprinklr AI differentiators vs Emplifi

- **AI+ Studio**: standalone AI governance layer (Emplifi has no equivalent — Cortex is the prototype)
- **Sprinklr AI Agent**: full deploy framework from days/weeks; Emplifi is exploring this space
- **30+ channels** vs Emplifi ~12 (includes Bluesky, Reddit, Snapchat, WhatsApp natively)
- **Multi-model orchestration**: single use case can route to multiple AI providers/models
- **Employee Advocacy, Workforce Management, Distributed Marketing** — Emplifi lacks these
- **Visual Insights**: AI image/video recognition for brand logo detection in UGC
- **Smart Budget Allocation**: reinforcement learning for real-time ad spend redistribution
