## Create, Schedule, and Preview a Post

Creating and scheduling posts in Emplifi Publisher is an easy process with plenty of options that give you control over the look and feel, and thus the impact, of your content.

When you create a post, you can also use advanced features such as [AI Composer](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/ai-composer) and [Emplifi Link in Bio](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/emplifi-link).

### Create and schedule a post

Steps:

1. Click Create post.
2. In the panel that opens, select one or more profiles, then click Use selected profiles.
3. Create the post's content using the available tools and options. To compose text for your post quickly, we suggest that you use [AI Composer](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/ai-composer).
4. (Optional) After you upload or create the asset, click Publish asset as and choose the media type from the dropdown menu:

   Your options will depend on the selected social network. You will see a notification if the asset is not compatible with the media type. To learn more, see [Publishing Formats, Options, and Sizes in Publisher](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/publishing-formats-options-and-sizes-in-publisher).

5. If there are any required content label groups, select at least one label from each required group. Only the users that can see the required content label group must select a label from the group.
6. Review the post's appearance using the Post preview menu. The post preview is an approximation of what the post will look like on the social channel you are publishing to. There may be differences between the preview in Publisher and the published post once the post goes live. LinkedIn document posts show only the first page of the document as part of the preview. Page counts are only available for PDF.
7. You can now publish or schedule your post.

   - Click Publish to make the post go live immediately.
   - Click Now or the Schedule icon to set the date and time for your post. The scheduling panel opens and you can proceed to step 7.

8. Select the date and the time, then click Schedule.
9. Back on the New content screen, click Schedule. Your posts appear in your publishing Calendar.

To start again, simply click Clear publisher.

## AI Composer

AI Composer is an artificial intelligence tool that allows you to quickly write posts and responses, and use them in your interactions with your clients and followers across social media.

AI Composer is the winner of the [2023 Artificial Intelligence Breakthrough Award](https://emplifi.io/press/emplifi-ai-composer-wins-top-honors-as-best-text-generative-ai-solution).

### Usage Guidelines and Policies

Human moderation is necessary. The decision to use and/or modify the AI-generated content is yours.

AI Composer is an artificial intelligence tool. While highly autonomous and constantly learning, some members of your audience may find its messages inappropriate and, ultimately, damaging to your brand.

This is why you cannot automatically deploy AI Composer's answers.

As per [OpenAI usage policy](https://platform.openai.com/docs/usage-policies), you cannot use AI Composer to generate the following types of content:

- Hate
- Harassment
- Violence
- Self-harm
- Sexual
- Political
- Spam
- Deception
- Malware

If you prompt AI Composer to generate such content, AI Composer may take the following actions:

- will not generate content
- will generate content that you do not expect 🙂

### Prerequisites

AI Composer is included in the Emplifi Business and Enterprise plans.

### Amplify or Relax the Emotions in Publisher

You can quickly tweak posts from the Publisher post editor to emphasize the emotions of the original text or make the text sound more informal and easy-going.

Steps:

1. Type the message for your post.
2. Click Amplify emotions or Relax tone. AI Composer gives four post suggestions.
3. Click Replace post text or Add to post.

### Open AI Composer

To access AI Composer, you must be in Publisher.

Steps:

1. In the Emplifi suite, click the Publisher icon.
2. Click Create post.
3. In the panel that opens, select one or more profiles, then click Use selected profiles.
4. Click Use AI Composer.
5. The AI Composer screen appears.

When you open AI Composer for a customized multi-post, each social channel has its own session of AI Composer.

### AI Composer Options

Before you begin composing your message, select the basic characteristics of the text.

#### Write Your Prompt Text

Define the topic and provide the details for the AI engine to construct the message. It can be a simple line such as Emplifi AI Composer coming soon to Emplifi Social Marketing Cloud or you can enter the Six Ws (who, what, when, where, why, and how).

Only enter the subject matter information details in the box.

Do not enter additional instructions (language, accent, slang, style, length, etc.) in the Prompt text box.

- Do: First human Charles Brubaker lands on Mars
- Don't: Compose opinion news piece lead about first human Charles Brubaker lands on Mars in 200 characters AP style, US English, no emoji, include philosophical question at the end.

#### Automatic Language Detection

AI Composer can detect the language after you type a couple of words into the prompt box.

For best results, we recommend that you type the prompt using full diacritics of the particular language (accents, stress signs, umlauts, etc.).

For example, when typing in French, type hôtel and très instead of hotel and tres.

You can change the target language at any point.

#### Brand Voice

Brand Voice is included in the Enterprise package or as a paid add-on for the Business package.

AI Composer can generate text in the voice of profiles that have at least 5 posts. While the selected profiles do not need to have their 5 posts published through Emplifi Publisher for Brand Voice to work, better results are created when there is more post data for AI Composer to use.

Sometimes AI Composer is unable to identify the brand voice of a profile from its published content. When this happens, more published posts are necessary before the AI can replicate the profile's tone and style. Consider the following information when using brand voice:

- We recommend using Publisher to schedule your posts. While not all posts need to be created through Publisher, some platforms limit the amount of historical data that we can retrieve. Typically, we can analyze up to the last 100 posts on a profile over a 90-day period. This means that if you connected a profile that doesn't have any usable data within that 90-day period, you will need to create more posts before brand voice can analyze your profile.
- Because the results are intended to match the voice of your brand, some AI composer options are unavailable if brand voice is turned on for a post.
- If you are creating a single post that you plan to publish to multiple profiles, the suggestions usually conform to the following logic:
  - The first suggestion is generated in the voice of the the first profile that you added to the post.
  - The second suggestion is in the voice of the second profile.
  - The third suggestion is in the voice of the third profile.
  - And the fourth suggestion is based on the voice of the fourth profile. There are only ever four suggestions at a time.
- Sometimes two or more suggestions may match the voice of one profile instead each profile having its own suggestion. If you suspect this is happening, try generating the prompt again, or use Brand Voice with one profile at a time to increase the accuracy of your results.

#### Languages

Choose one of the available languages to generate messages targeted at your diverse global audience.

You can also enter the prompt in a different language than the one that you selected. For example, you can type your prompt in Slovak and select English as the language in which you want AI to generate the text.

Languages are incredibly complex systems with various degrees of online proliferation. These factors may impact how effectively AI can process available resources. We advise that you check the grammar of generated text, especially for [synthetic languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_language) such as Czech, Arabic, Italian, or Russian. Also see: [Analytic languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_language).

**Supported Languages**

Click here to see the list of supported languages:

Arabic, Catalan, Chinese, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Estonian, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Portuguese (BR), Romanian, Russian, Slovak, Slovenian, Spanish, Spanish (LATAM), Swedish, Turkish

#### Format

Define the format of the message based on your target audience. This option is not available when using Brand Voice.

- General
- News

#### Tone of Voice

Match the language of the message to the nature of the news or information about your brand. For example, choose the Excited option in a post about the birth of a baby panda. This option is not available when using Brand Voice.

Educational, Energetic, Excited, Happy, Inspirational, Neutral, Optimistic, Professional, Recommended, Sad, Sales pitch

#### Additional Elements

You can further refine the text by including or excluding additional elements to increase engagement:

- hashtags (such as #, @)
- emojis (such as 🙂 )
- text length (short, medium, long)
- questions (not available when using Brand Voice)

### Generate Text

Click Generate text to generate four suggestions that you can use in your post.

#### More Like This

When you see a suggestion you like, click More like this on one of the suggestions created by AI Composer to generate four more suggestions that are similar to the one you liked.

#### Use a Generated Message

On the message you like the most, click one of the following:

- **Replace text post** Replaces the text in the Post text section's editor field with the text of the prompt.
- **Add to post** Adds the selected text to the Post text section's editor field.

Click Apply. The post appears in the Publisher's text field.

#### Combine and Edit Generated Messages

1. Find the messages that are the closest to what you have in mind.
2. One by one, select and click Add to post on each of them. The texts appear in the Post text section's editor field.
3. Edit the post as you would in any text editor.
4. When you are happy with the result, click Apply. The post appears in the Publisher's text field.

After you compose your message, you can continue to prepare your post in the usual manner as a standalone post or you can use it in your [Emplifi Link in Bio](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/emplifi-link) microsite.

## Emplifi Link in Bio

Emplifi Link is a Publisher link in bio feature that allows you to create and customize a dedicated link-in-bio page (microsite).

You can then schedule your link in bio content (photos, reels, links, grids) to align the page with your social media campaigns.

With Emplifi Link, you do not have to rely on third party services to get around the Instagram's internal limitation that prevents you from adding clickable links in posts.

### Prerequisites

You must have Emplifi's Business or Enterprise package to use Emplifi Link.

### Create a link in bio page

Emplifi Link in Bio is integrated in the Publisher section. When you first click Link in Bio, the feature's welcome page opens.

Steps:

1. Click Create a page. The Create New Page panel opens.
2. Write the end of the URL. Important:
   - Page URLs may only contain letters, numbers, underscores ("_"), and dashes ("-").
   - The URL cannot be changed later.
3. Create a name for the page. The page name is visible only on the Link in Bio pages overview. After you create the page, you can customize the page title, bio, and appearance for visitors.
4. (Optional) Write a description for the page.
5. Set the [visibility](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/emplifi-link#visibility) for the page.
6. Click Create. Your page goes live without any content and the page editor opens.

You can now [Configure Your Link in Bio Page](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/getting-started-with-emplifi-link) and [Design Your Emplifi Link Page](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/design-your-emplifi-link-microsite).

After you finish configuring and designing your page, copy the URL and paste it into your social profile bio.

The URL is always displayed on top of your Emplifi Link workspace.

### Page Visibility within Emplifi

By default, pages are created with Global access. This means all users with the appropriate roles and permissions are able to see, edit, or delete the page.

If you instead set visibility to Specific users, only Link in bio admins and the specific users that you share the page with have access, and their access is determined according to their Roles & permissions in Settings. This prevents you from accidentally losing access to a page if all the users whom the page is shared with are no longer with the company. To learn more, see [Link in Bio User Permissions](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/emplifi-link-in-bio-user-permissions).

To share the Link in bio page with Specific Users, follow these steps:

If you are a Link in bio admin but cannot click the Share button for a page, please refresh your screen and try again.

1. Click the ellipsis button (…) and click Share.
2. Choose whether to give Global access or give access only to Specific Users.
3. Click Add users to choose which users to share the page with.
4. Click Share. If Visibility is Specific Users and no users are added, access will be set to You and all account admins.

### Build link in bio content and workflows

In the next sections, you will learn how to create and edit your link in bio content and how to integrate Emplifi Link in to your Publisher workflows.

- [Analyze Emplifi Link Performance](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/analytics-for-emplifi-link-pages)

### GDPR compliance and data limitations

Your link in bio page is GDPR compliant and will display the cookies notice.

As per GDPR requirements, the link-in-bio module cannot access data older than 90 days.

To learn more about historical data availability, see [Content Types, Historical Data, and Update Frequency in Community](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/content-types-historical-data-update-frequency).

Instagram business profiles are just like personal profiles, except they also allow users to:

- Promote posts directly from the app
- View more detailed performance metrics (Reach, Impressions) with Instagram Insights
- Add business contact information so customers can reach you through the app

To create an Instagram business profile, you need to link it to a Facebook Page. To do this, you need to be a Facebook admin of the Page. Moving forward, the posts you choose to share from Instagram on Facebook will be on that Page.

Business profiles cannot be private.

Before you enable publishing for your Instagram profile, ensure you are a Facebook admin or an editor of the Page which is associated with your Instagram business profile. You can then follow these steps:

1. Go to Settings.
2. Click Profiles.
3. Find the Instagram profile and in the Profile details tab, Connection section, click Connect publishing for Instagram publishing.

- Your account is in an exempt region or subject to a different Meta policy.

You can learn more at Meta Business Help Center, [https://www.facebook.com/business/help/623552069600842](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/623552069600842).

People love Instagram reels: cats, epic fails, makeup tutorials, mukbang – you name it, we're watching it. In fact, approximately 2.35 billion people interact with reels every month.

It's clearly a winning post type for the platform. So if you want to create engaging content on Instagram, you shouldn't rely on photos alone. Mix it up with reels and make posts that really resonate with your audiences.

### Publish Instagram Reels through Publisher

It's easy to post Reels to Instagram directly from Publisher.

When you select a video asset for an Instagram post, Publisher automatically selects Reels in the Publish assets as: dropdown menu. To instead learn how to publish Instagram stories, see [Schedule and Publish Instagram Stories](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/instagram-stories-scheduling-with-emplifi).

Steps:

1. In Publisher, click Create post.
2. Select the Instagram profile or profiles and click Use Selected Profiles. Your Instagram profile must first be connected to Emplifi. To learn more, see [Add an Owned Profile for Your Instagram Account](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/how-to-add-owned-instagram-profiles).
3. Select one of the following options and choose a video asset to use for the Reel:
   - Upload Media
   - Import from web/cloud
   - Upload from Collections When you import an asset from a collection, the original post description for that asset is automatically added to the description field.
4. (Optional) If Publisher detects formatting issues with your video asset, follow the on-screen instructions to correct the problems.
5. (Optional) Customize the thumbnail for your Instagram video:
   - Upload. You can choose from a variety of locations such as from your own device, Dropbox, Google Drive, a web location, and more.
   - Capture from the video.
6. Write a great description to add the finishing touch to your post.
7. You can publish your post directly, save it for later, or even schedule it to be published at a time when it will get the most hearts and comments. To learn more, see [Create, Schedule, and Preview a Post](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/create-schedule-and-preview-a-post).

If your Reel includes audio that has a copyright, Instagram automatically detects and attributes the audio to the creator. Otherwise, the reel is uploaded as original audio. To learn more, visit the Instagram help center and read [What audio you can use in your reel on Instagram](https://help.instagram.com/329208821595430).

Publisher allows you to keep track of all of your posts. The lefthand side of the Publisher section houses your Sent, Scheduled and Dark Posts, in addition to Assigned posts and posts that are still awaiting approval or have encountered a publishing error.

Sent posts are posts which have been published. Scheduled posts are still awaiting publishing.

## Schedule and Publish to YouTube

In this guide, we'll share some important information, along with tips and tricks, so that you can get the most out of this feature.

### Connect Your YouTube Channel

Follow the standard process to connect a new YouTube channel in Emplifi. YouTube requires that you have the Owner role to authorize a third-party connection. Make sure you have the Owner role for the channel before continuing.

To learn more, see [Add an Owned Profile for Your YouTube Channel](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/add-an-owned-profile-for-your-youtube-channel).

### Schedule or Publish YouTube Video

Scheduling and publishing works the same way as for other networks in Emplifi. To learn more, see [Create, Schedule, and Preview a Post](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/create-schedule-and-preview-a-post).

Posts scheduled for Youtube that have an hour or less before their publication time cannot have their publication cancelled. See [YouTube Publishing](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/youtube-publishing) and [Emergency Action - Stop Publishing](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/emergency-action-stop-publishing) for more information.

### Available YouTube Video's Properties

We understand YouTube Studio is a powerful and cherished tool therefore we decided to implement everything the YouTube API allows. That being said, besides the obvious properties such a title or description, you can also set:

- Custom thumbnails*
- Add the video automatically to multiple playlists
- Mark the age restrictions
- Visibility
- Tags
- Set the language of the video and add the subtitles' file
- Recording date
- License
- Category

Thumbnails for Youtube shorts can only be customized through the official Youtube apps for IOS and Android. After you use Emplifi Publisher to upload a Youtube short to your channel, you can use the official Youtube app to select a frame from the video to use as the video thumbnail. To learn more, see Youtube's official documentation at [https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/10343433](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/10343433).

### End Screen

We can hear you… where are the End Screens? Unfortunately, this part of YouTube native capabilities is still limited for third parties.

The silver lining is that you can add the end screens by using YouTube Studio anytime after Publisher successfully uploads the video. Alternatively, you can upload the video as private and have it there waiting for your final end screen touches.
