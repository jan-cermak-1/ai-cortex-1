# Unified Analytics

Unified Analytics brings together data from across the Emplifi platform into one centralized reporting experience. Instead of switching between modules, you can view performance metrics, compare results, and analyze trends, all in one place.

## Unified Analytics overview

With Unified Analytics, you can:

- View performance across multiple Emplifi products
- Analyze data across platforms and accounts
- Drill down into detailed metrics
- Set custom timeframes
- Compare performance across date ranges
- Interact with visualizations to explore insights

As soon as your data sources are connected (social profiles, ad accounts, listening queries, etc.), boards automatically populate with ready-made visualizations.

## Unified Analytics structure

Unified Analytics is structured into modules, boards, and widgets. Understanding this structure makes it easier to navigate and customize your analysis.

Refer to the sections below to learn more about each component of Unified Analytics.

### Boards

A board is a workspace within a module.

Each board contains multiple widgets that visualize related metrics for a specific reporting focus (for example, engagement, reach, or campaign performance).

Boards are:

- Pre-built and ready to use
- Automatically populated when data sources are connected
- Designed around common reporting needs

For more details, refer to: [Unified Analytics - Boards Overview](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/unified-analytics-boards-overview).

### Widgets

A widget is a visual representation of data.

Widgets:

- Display specific metrics
- Are pre-configured (no setup required)
- Use defined visualization types (charts, graphs, tables, etc.)
- May include interactive elements for deeper exploration

Many widgets allow you to:

- Drill down into data
- Change timeframes
- Compare performance across periods
- Filter by profiles, campaigns, or labels

For more details, refer to: [Unified Analytics - Widgets Overview](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/unified-analytics-widgets-overview).

### Controls

Controls allow you to adjust what data is displayed on a board or widget.

Examples of controls include:

- Timeframe selection
- Time comparison range
- Profile or account selection
- Filters

Controls dynamically update all relevant widgets on the board.

## Unified Analytics - Boards Overview

Unified Analytics is made up of various modules, boards, and widgets.

In the right side panel under Discover, you can see the modules, such as Social profiles, Paid, Campaigns & labels, etc. Modules are made up of various boards.

A board is a workspace made up for individual widgets, which display data visualizations.

As Unified Analytics modules are pre-defined and loaded with widgets, all you need to do is specify the data sources.

### Select your board's data sources

By default, boards are empty and you must choose the data source or sources that you want to analyze.

A data source can be a profile, platform, labels, bot, etc. depending on the module and/or board. You can select one or multiple items from the list.

To select your board's data sources:

1. In Unified Analytics, navigate to the relevant module that contains the board. A blank pre-defined board appears.
2. In the controls bar, define your preferred data sources. For example, for a Social profiles board, you may select your owned Instagram profiles.
3. Optionally, adjust the date range. By default, boards load and analyze the last 30 days of data. To change that, simply click the time period control (that says Last 30 days) and adjust the time span.
4. To compare two time periods head to head, refer to: [Time Over Time Comparison in Unified Analytics](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/time-over-time-comparison-in-unified-analytics).
5. Optionally, adjust the aggregation type. You can display trends and evolution charts aggregated by day, week, month, quarter, or year.

Unified Analytics connects to the data sources and displays visualizations of your data.

For boards with vertical bar charts with many bars, if all bars cannot fit within the widget's width, an aggregated "Other" bar will appear. The bars with the lowest values (typically those on the right) that do not fit within the selected width and widget size will be grouped into the "Other" category.

To view the entire data set, export the data as an XLSX or CSV file. For more details, refer to: [Share a Unified Analytics Board](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/share-a-unified-analytics-board) or [Share a Unified Analytics Widget](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/share-a-unified-analytics-widget).

If you select multiple data sources, you will be able to see aggregated data and basic comparisons among of the sources, such as profiles, that you selected. For more information, refer to: [Compare a Profile with Another Profile](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/compare-a-profile-with-another-profile).

### Control widget variations with toggles

Certain widgets allow you toggle between displaying visualizations of different sets of data.

Toggles are currently supported for the following data:

- Organic vs Paid data split is supported on Facebook boards. For more information, refer to: [Paid and Organic Data in Unified Analytics](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/paid-and-organic-data-in-unified-analytics)
- Interactions vs Interactions per 1k followers* is supported in boards within the following modules:
  - Facebook
  - Instagram
  - X (formerly known as Twitter)
  - YouTube
  - LinkedIn

## Unified Analytics - Widgets Overview

Widgets in Unified Analytics are composed of several parts. Refer to the sections below to learn more about their structure.

### Tooltips

Tooltips appear when you hover your cursor over a question mark icon (?). They allow you to learn about what particular widgets display.

To learn about the definitions of all widgets, refer to: [Unified Analytics - List of Widgets](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/unified-analytics-list-of-widgets).

### Widget data

Hover the cursor over a specific section of the widget to see a more detailed view of the displayed data background such as:

- date
- metric
- source details (platform, profile color, etc.)
- exact number

Depending on their configurations, widgets can display the following:

- Widget name
- Description
- Pop-up information boxes
- Time period
- Aggregation type
- Post vs Profile
- Drilling options (Interactive)
- Time over time comparison details

Click the visualization to display the actual content that the widget analyzes with all filters applied.

For boards with vertical bar charts with many bars, if all bars cannot fit within the widget's width, an aggregated "Other" bar will appear. The bars with the lowest values (typically those on the right) that do not fit within the selected width and widget size will be grouped into the "Other" category.

To view the entire data set, export the data as an XLSX or CSV file. For more details, refer to: [Share a Unified Analytics Board](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/share-a-unified-analytics-board) or [Share a Unified Analytics Widget](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/share-a-unified-analytics-widget).

### Click to content

Interactive widgets allow you to review the underlying content in the Content hub. To view the related content, click the ellipses icon and select Click to content.

Interactive widgets take the Content hub integration further as they allow you to drill to the very specific content behind a specific section of the chart.

For more information about how to use interactive widgets for in-depth content analysis, refer to: [Drill Into Interactive Widgets](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/drill-into-interactive-widgets).

Many content boards contain only interactive widgets. If the board is a mix of standard and interactive content widgets, interactive widgets are indicated with a dedicated label.
