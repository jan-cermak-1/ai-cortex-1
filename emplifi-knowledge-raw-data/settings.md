## Supported Browsers

The Emplifi platform supports the following browsers:

- Google Chrome (six latest stable versions)
- Microsoft Edge (six latest stable versions)
- Firefox (six latest stable versions)
- Safari (two latest stable versions)

For maximum compatibility with all the features of the Emplifi platform, we recommend that you use Google Chrome.

Using an unsupported browser or an older version of a supported browser may result in a suboptimal user experience: some Emplifi features and functionality may not be correctly displayed, fully supported, or available.

### Browser tips

Your browser must have JavaScript enabled.

The compatibility and performance of the Emplifi platform may be affected by your browser add-ons/extensions and network settings.

### Clipboard access

Certain features of the Emplifi platform, such as the quick-link feature in the Emplifi Link asset editor, require clipboard access. To ensure these features work correctly, you must grant Emplifi permission to access your browser's clipboard.

By default, Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge both ask for permission before granting a website permission to your clipboard data.

Emplifi is unable to read clipboard data from the Safari browser.

By default, Firefox does not easily allow clipboard access. Instead, you must enable clipboard access in the `about:config` for your browser. Unfortunately, this enables clipboard access for all websites. This can result in an insecure browsing experience that exposes you to cybersecurity risks. For the reasons described above, Emplifi recommends using browsers other than Firefox for managing your clipboard access to the Emplifi website.

## Session Duration

The session timeout is seven days since the last activity. Every time a user performs an action in the Emplifi account, their session timeout is reset to seven days.

## Connecting and Managing Ad Accounts

Connecting an ad account allows you to access a comprehensive view of your ad spend, costs, and engagement. Using these ad insights, report on your performance, see what is resonating with your audience, and discover how you can spend smarter to maximize the value of your ad strategy, and ultimately, deliver on business objectives.

This article is for the users who have an account role with the "Add Pages & Profiles" permission (that is, for Account Admins and the users who have a custom account role with the "Add Pages & Profiles" permission under "Pages & Profiles"; see [Account Roles](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/account-roles)).

### Supported platforms

You can add the following ad accounts to your Emplifi account:

**Meta** (see [Add a Meta Ad Account](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/add-a-facebook-and-instagram-ad-account)): Facebook, Instagram, Threads, WhatsApp, Messenger, Audience network

**TikTok** (see [Add a TikTok Ad Account](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/add-a-tiktok-ad-account)): TikTok, Pangle, TikTok Global App Bundle

**X (formerly Twitter)** (see [Add an X (formerly Twitter) Ad Account](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/add-an-x-formerly-twitter-ad-account)): X, Publisher network

### Where to find ad accounts

You can access all the ad accounts in the Settings section of your Emplifi account, under Channels -> Ad accounts.

### Manage access to ad accounts

Only users who are assigned to an ad account can access this ad account.

**Ad account permissions**

What a user is allowed to do with an ad account is managed by the ad account permission assigned to the user for this ad account:

- **View** - The users with the "View" permission can view data of the assigned ad accounts in Unified Analytics, Dashboard, and Content (see "Analyze your ad performance" further in this article).
- **Manage** - The users with the "Manage" permission can view data of the assigned ad accounts in Unified Analytics, Dashboard, and Content, assign users to and remove users from the ad accounts, and change the other users' ad account permissions.

When a user is not assigned to an ad account, they have no access to this ad account at all.

**Who can and cannot access ad accounts**

By default, all Account Admins are assigned to all ad accounts in the Emplifi account and have the "Manage" permission for each ad account. This cannot be changed.

The user who initially connected an ad account and any user who connected to the ad account at any time later are also automatically assigned to this ad account with the "Manage" permission.

A user who is not an Account Admin does not have access to ad accounts unless they are assigned to the ad accounts. To grant a user access to an ad account, assign this user to the ad account with a specific permission (see further in this article).

**Assign users to an ad account**

When you assign a user to an ad account, you grant this user access to the ad account and define the user's permission for the ad account.

By default, all Account Admins are assigned to all ad accounts in the Emplifi account. You do not have to assign a user who is an Account Admin to the ad account - this user was assigned to all the ad accounts automatically once they were assigned the Account Admin account role.

To be able to assign users to an ad account, you must be an Account Admin (see [Account Roles](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/account-roles)) or be assigned to this ad account with the "Manage" permission.

Steps:
1. Go to Settings -> Channels -> Ad accounts.
2. Click the ad account that you want to assign users to. The ad account opens.
3. Click the Users tab.
4. Click +Add user.
5. The dialog for assigning users to the ad account pops up.
6. Select the users to assign to the ad account.
7. From the Ad account permission for new users dropdown, select the permission to assign to the selected users. By default, the "View" ad account permission is selected.
8. Click Add users. The users are assigned to the ad account and appear in the list of users on the Users screen. The assigned users are granted access to the ad account according to the selected permission.

**Assign users to multiple ad accounts**

You can assign one or more users to multiple ad accounts at the same time.

When you assign users to one ad account, you can choose what permission to assign the users for this ad account. When you assign users to multiple ad accounts simultaneously, you cannot choose the permission: all the users will be assigned to the ad accounts with the "View" permission. If you want to then change it to a different ad account permission for some users and some ad accounts, you need to do it for each ad account individually (see "Change a user's ad account permission for an ad account" further in this article).

By default, all Account Admins are assigned to all ad accounts in the Emplifi account. You do not have to assign a user who is an Account Admin to the ad account - this user was assigned to all the ad accounts automatically once they were assigned the Account Admin account role.

To be able to assign users to multiple ad accounts, you must be an Account Admin (see [Account Roles](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/account-roles)) or be assigned to these ad accounts with the "Manage" permission.

Steps:
1. Go to Settings -> Channels -> Ad accounts.
2. Select the ad accounts that you want to assign users to. You can first filter the ad accounts to narrow down the initial selection (see further in this article). The bar with action buttons appears at the bottom of the page.
3. Click Users, select the users to assign to the ad accounts, and click Apply.
4. The users are assigned to the ad accounts with the "View" ad account permission. If you want to change it to a different permission for some users and some ad accounts, do it for each ad account individually (see "Change a user's ad account permission for an ad account" further in this article).

**Find out what ad account permission a user has**

To be able to find out what ad account permission a user has for an ad account, you must be an Account Admin (see [Account Roles](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/account-roles)) or be assigned to this ad account with any ad account permission.

All Account Admins have the "Manage" ad account permission for all ad accounts by default.

The user who initially connected an ad account and any user who connected to the ad account at any time later are automatically assigned to this ad account with the "Manage" ad account permission.

Steps:
1. Go to Settings -> Channels -> Ad accounts.
2. Select the ad account for which you want to check the user's ad account permission. The ad account opens.
3. Click the Users tab.
4. Find the user. The ad account permission is displayed in the Ad account permission dropdown.

**Change a user's ad account permission for an ad account**

Changing a user's ad account permission for an ad account changes what a user is allowed to do with the ad account.

You cannot change a user's ad account permission if this user is an Account Admin (see [Account Roles](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/account-roles)). All Account Admins have the "Manage" ad account permission for all ad accounts by default. This cannot be changed.

To be able to change the ad account permission for the other user, you must be an Account Admin (see [Account Roles](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/account-roles)) or be assigned to the ad account with the "Manage" ad account permission.

Steps:
1. Go to Settings -> Channels -> Ad accounts.
2. Select the ad account for which you want to change the user's ad account permission. The ad account opens.
3. Click the Users tab.
4. Find the user whose ad account permission you want to change, and select the new permission in the Ad account permission dropdown.
5. To change the ad account permissions for multiple users at once, select the users, click Ad account permission on the bar with action buttons that appears at the bottom of the page, and select the new ad account permission to assign.
6. The change is automatically applied and saved.

**Remove users from an ad account**

When you remove a user from an ad account, this user loses access to the ad account. They no longer can see this ad account or view data of this ad account in Unified Analytics, Dashboard, and Content.

By default, all Account Admins are assigned to all ad accounts in the Emplifi account and have the "Manage" ad account permission for each ad account. You cannot remove an Account Admin from an ad account.

Steps:
1. Go to Settings -> Channels -> Ad accounts.
2. Click the ad account that you want to remove users from. The ad account opens.
3. Click the Users tab.
4. Hover over the user that you want to remove from the ad account, and click the trash can icon that appears.
5. To remove multiple users from the ad account, select the users to remove, and click Remove on the bar with action buttons that appears at the bottom of the page.
6. Confirm the deletion. The user is removed from the ad account.

### Filter ad accounts

Filter ad accounts to display only the ad accounts that meet certain criteria.

To be able to filter ad accounts, you must be an Account Admin (see [Account Roles](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/account-roles)) or be assigned to the ad accounts with any ad account permission.

The following filtering criteria are available for ad accounts:

- **Platforms** - Facebook & Instagram (covers all supported Meta platforms), TikTok, X
- **Connection status** - Connected, Expired (similar to connection status of profiles; see [Check and Establish Connections of Owned Profiles](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/check-and-establish-connections-of-owned-profiles))
- **Users** - The users who are assigned to ad accounts

Steps:
1. Go to Settings -> Channels -> Ad accounts.
2. Click Filter on the top right.
3. The filter panel opens.
4. Set up the filter criteria, and click Filter Ad accounts. The ad accounts that meet the filter criteria are listed.
5. To clear the filter and return to listing all the ad accounts, click the cross icon next to Filter on the top right.

### Find out who added an ad account and when

The information about who added an ad account and when it was done is available depending on your account role.

The information about when an ad account was added to the Emplifi account is visible to the users who have an account role with the "View Pages & Profiles" permission.

The information about who added an ad account to the Emplifi account is visible to the users who have an account role with the "View Users" permission. If the user who added the ad account was deleted from the Emplifi account since, the information about who added the ad account is not displayed and is not visible to anyone.

To be able to find out who added an ad account and when, you must be an Account Admin (see [Account Roles](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/account-roles)) or be assigned to this ad account with any ad account permission.

Steps:
1. Go to Settings -> Channels -> Ad accounts.
2. Find and click the ad account. The information about the user who added the ad account and when it was done is displayed on the Connections tab.

### Change the color code of an ad account

Customize the default color of any ad account. This determines how the ad account appears in various environments across the Emplifi platform, for example, in the analytics tooling and in the Content module.

You can update the color code of multiple ad accounts at once.

Steps:
1. Go to Settings -> Channels -> Ad accounts.
2. Select the ad accounts whose color code you want to update. You can first filter the ad accounts to narrow down the initial selection (see earlier in this article). The bar with action buttons appears at the bottom of the page.
3. Click the color code icon, and select the color.
4. The color code changes for the selected ad accounts.

### Delete an ad account

Deleting an ad account deletes all the data related to this ad account. This data is no longer visible in the Emplifi account and cannot be reviewed or analyzed.

To be able to delete an ad account, you must be an Account Admin (see [Account Roles](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/account-roles)).

Steps:
1. Go to Settings -> Channels -> Ad accounts.
2. Hover over the ad account that you want to delete, and click the trash can icon that appears.
3. To delete multiple ad accounts, select the ad accounts to delete, and click Remove on the bar with action buttons that appears at the bottom of the page.
4. Confirm the deletion. The ad account is deleted.

### Analyze your ad performance

You can analyze your ad performance from various perspectives:

- **Review aggregated ad data** - Access essential paid metrics for your ad accounts and campaigns, and compare paid activities across multiple social platforms. Go to Unified Analytics, and click Paid (see [Paid and Organic Data in Unified Analytics](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/paid-and-organic-data-in-unified-analytics)).
- **Discover ad-level insights** - Oversee all ads being served from your ad accounts, and review metrics for each individual piece of ad content. Go to Content, and click Ads (see [Ads in Content Hub](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/ads-in-content-hub)).
- **Create a dashboard** - Go to Dashboard, and add widgets from the Ads and paid content performance category (see [Ads widgets in Dashboard](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/ads-widgets-in-dashboard) and [Create a New Dashboard](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/create-a-new-dashboard)).

To be able to see and use an ad account in these modules of the Emplifi platform (that is, to select an ad account as a data source in a Dashboard widget or in Unified Analytics, or to see the ad account when searching for content in Content), you must be assigned to this ad account (see "Manage access to ad accounts" earlier in this article).

## How to Integrate Advanced Permissions with Rule-Based Labeling

To leverage advanced label permissions to the max, they are smoothly integrated with your Rule-Based Labeling efforts. This means that you can create Labeling Rules for Labels with Private, Shared, or Global permissions.

For more information, see [Set Up Labels](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/how-to-set-up-labels).

We understand that Task Automation is sensitive. To avoid any misuse, you can define which user can create new rules in the Roles & Permissions settings.

To avoid people from interfering with others' Automated Labeling Rules, only the owner of a rule can make changes to it.

To create Admin permissions, go to the Roles & Permissions settings and select: 'Create and Edit Global Profile Labels, Content Labels, and Label Groups', 'Edit All Shared Labels and Label Groups' and 'Edit All Automated Labeling Rules Across Account'. These permissions allow you to see and edit all labels and all rules. Both permissions are by default turned on for Account Admins.

## Set Up Labels

With labels, you can categorize and organize the profiles and content in your account. You can also set permissions for each label and label group to ensure that only the right people have access to the right labels.

Labeling in Emplifi allows brands to:

- Take an organized approach to labeling by bundling Labels into Label groups.
- Govern the use and visibility of Labels with custom permissions and shared visibility options.
- Designate required label groups so that users who can see the group must select at least one label from each required group before they can schedule or publish a post.
- Set advanced permissions for existing and future rule-based Labels. Check [How to Integrate Advanced Permissions with Rule-Based Labeling](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/integrate-permissions-with-rule-based-labeling) if you want to know how to integrate advanced permissions with automated labeling.

This guide will help you with the steps needed to create a solid Labeling structure.

To get the most out of Emplifi, we heavily recommend you use labels in your workflow.

- How to Assign Content Labels to Label Group
- How to Control Label Visibility & Set Permissions: Default Labels Permissions Setup - Account Role, Account Role - How to Set Label Permissions, How to Define Label Permissions for the Specific Users Visibility, Visibility Review

### How to Create Labels

If you go into Settings → Labels, you will notice that the menu is subdivided into three sections:

- **Profile Labels** - Labels that are assigned to a profile.
- **Content Labels** - Labels that are assigned to content posts and Calendar notes
- **Content Label Groups** - Labels that are used to group Content Labels.

To create a new Profile Label, Content Label, or Content Label Group go to the Account Settings → Labels. Select one of the three submenus at the top according to the type of Label you're creating, and then press the "Create Profile Label/Content Label/Label Group" button.

**Creating Profile Labels**

1. Go to the Account Settings → Labels → Profile Labels. Press the Create Profile Label button.
2. Choose a name for your Label(s). Labels bulk creation: Users can create multiple Labels at once. To separate multiple Labels, press Enter on your keyboard.
3. Select the visibility of the Label(s): Global (everyone in the account), Specific Users (select specific users and/or user groups; see [Organize Users into User Groups](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/organize-users-into-user-groups)), Private (only visible to the user who creates these Label(s)).
4. Assign Social Profiles - users can select any monitored profile in the account (whether it's a public or an owned profile). During the initial Label creation, this step is optional. Users can also assign profiles later on, if they have the permissions.
5. Click Finish once you're done. The Label(s) are immediately created and added to the list.

**Creating Content Labels**

1. Go to the Account Settings → Labels → Content Labels. Press the Create Content Label button.
2. Choose a name for your Label(s). Labels Bulk Creation: Users can create multiple Labels at once - To do so, separate multiple Labels by pressing Enter.
3. Select the visibility of the Label(s): Global, Specific Users, or Private.
4. (Optional) Assign to Label Groups. If a Label group is not yet created, the user can create it during this step, by pressing the + New Label Group button. Please note that you can only create one Label group at a time using this method, and the visibility will be automatically set to private. Once created, the Label group is automatically assigned.
5. Click Finish once you're done, to create the Label(s). The Label(s) are immediately added to the list.

**Creating Content Label Groups**

1. Go to the Account Settings → Labels → Content Label Groups. Press the Create Label Group button.
2. Choose a name for your Label group(s). Labels Bulk Creation: Users can create multiple Label groups at once - To do so, separate multiple Label groups by pressing Enter.
3. (Optional) Choose whether or not to enable Required for publishing. When a label group is required for publishing, users that have the group visible must select at least one label from the label group before scheduling or publishing a post.
4. Select the visibility of the Label groups: Global, Specific Users, or Private.
5. Assign Content Labels: You can add existing Content Labels to the Content Label Group; You can create a new Content Label during this step, by pressing the + New Content Label button. Please note that you can only create one Content Label at a time using this method, and the Label will be private. Once created, the Content Label is automatically assigned to this Content Label Group.
6. Once you're done, click Finish to create the Content Label Group(s).

### How to Assign Content Labels to Content Label Groups

There are four ways of assigning Content Labels to Content Label Groups. Two of them are already explained in the sub-sections above: 'Creating Content Labels', and 'Creating Content Label Groups'.

You can choose between the following two methods any time after the creation of a label or label group: Via the Content Labels Editor, Via the Content Label Group Editor.

**Assigning Content Labels to Label Groups via the Content Labels Editor**

1. Go to Account Settings → Labels → Content Labels.
2. Press on a Content Label from the list. A new window with the Content Label Editor is displayed.
3. Under the Label Groups Section, Click the 'Assign to Label Groups' button.
4. A new window appears with a list of Content Label Groups possible to be assigned to.
5. Select the Content Label Group(s) from the list.
6. Press 'Assign'. The window closes. The Content Label has now been assigned to the chosen Content Label Group(s).
7. Press 'Save', otherwise the changes to the Content Label won't be applied.

**Assigning Content Labels to Label Groups via the Label Groups Editor**

1. Go to Account Settings → Labels → Content Label Groups.
2. Select a Label Group from the list. A new window with the Label Group Editor is displayed.
3. Under the Content Labels Section, Click the 'Assign Content Labels' button. A new window appears with a list of Content Labels that can be assigned to this Label Group.
4. Select the Content Label(s) from the list.
5. Press 'Assign'. The window closes. The Content Label(s) are now assigned to this Label Group.
6. Press 'Save', otherwise the changes won't be applied.

### How to Control Label Visibility & Set Permissions

There are three different visibility options:

- **Global** - Everyone in the account can see this Label, depending on the users' Account Role. To check and set who can manage them, review Roles & Permissions in Account Settings (see [User Roles and Permissions](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/user-roles-and-permissions)).
- **Private** - Only visible to the user who creates these Labels
- **Specific Users** - Manual selection of the users who can edit, apply or view the Label (only edit, or view in the case of Content Label Groups)

**Default Labels Permissions Setup - Account Role**

- All users can create, apply, and remove their own private labels.
- All users can see global labels across the account.
- All users can share their private labels with specific users. This means the label will no longer be private but will be accessible only by the chosen users.
- Users with Account Admin role (see [Account Roles](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/account-roles)) have the ability to: Edit shared labels and label groups of other users; Edit global labels and label groups; Edit all automated labeling rules.

**Account Role - How to Set Label Permissions**

1. Go to Account Settings → Roles & Permissions → Account Roles
2. Press an account role from the list to adjust it, or create a new one
3. The Account Role settings window opens. Find the Labels section
4. Check/uncheck the Labels permissions fields accordingly
5. Click Save once you're done
6. Go to Settings → Users, select the user, and under User Details, change the Account Role if needed.

**How to Set User-Permissions for Shared Labels**

1. Go to the Labels Settings and select the Label.
2. The Label details window appears. Switch to the Label Visibility section. Here you can define which users can view, apply, or edit profile and Content Labels
3. Set the Visibility to Specific Users.
4. Select the Label permission for each user. For Content Label Groups, only the edit, or view options are available.

### Visibility Review

The visibility review column appears only when a user has access to a label group but does not have access to one or more labels that are part of that label group.

Example: I have a 'Halloween' Label Group that I want to be visible to Team A, Bob, and Adam. This Group has three Labels in it, however, Bob, Adam, and Team A are all missing the visibility to one or several Labels in the 'Halloween' Label Group.

To sort out these inconsistencies, the Visibility Review informs you about any inconsistencies in permissions in the detail section of the Label/Label Group.

## Automate Labeling with Rules

Instead of applying labels to content manually, automate labeling across all your social channels. To do so, create rules and associate them with your chosen profiles or listening queries.

A rule is a set of conditions that you can use to label many posts at once ("if content includes ABC, then label it with XYZ"). If a post fits the conditions, your chosen label will be automatically added to it.

### How the rules work

A rule can be set across many different profiles and platforms (such as Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Pinterest, and more - the supported platforms depend on the type of content that you want to label, see "Create a rule" further in this article) and mentions from the Listening module. You can set a rule to run permanently or schedule it to run only within a certain period.

You can pause or remove a rule at any time.

When removing a rule, you can choose to also remove the labels on the content that this rule added. Doing this does not remove the labels themselves from the account.

Removing a rule removes only the labels that have been placed automatically. Labels placed manually remain untouched.

### Rule conditions

A rule can contain one or more conditions. The rule is applied only when all the conditions are true.

Each condition can contain multiple keywords. Within a condition, you can choose: Whether the keywords should be included or not included in the post text; Whether it applies to any or all the keywords in the condition.

For example: IF the text in a post includes any of the following keywords: `#festivalfashion`, `#outfitoftheday`, `aviators`, `summer`, `beach waves`, `sunglasses` AND does not include any of the following keywords: `coachella`, `#picoftheday` THEN and only then will that post automatically be labeled with the label `Summer`.

## Set Up Looker Studio Connector with Emplifi

Integrating social media insights alongside the rest of your marketing or business intelligence data gives you a holistic understanding of your entire digital strategy. With Emplifi Looker Studio Connector you'll be able to include your social media data from Emplifi Public API in your charts and graphs together with your own data.

Only data from the profiles monitored in your Emplifi platform will be available.

The Looker Studio Connector is a layer between Emplifi API and Looker Studio itself. The majority of metrics available in the Emplifi API are also available in the Connector. For more information about Emplifi Public API and a description of metrics, visit https://api.emplifi.io/

All the data pulled from the API will depend on the pages and corresponding data connections monitored in your Emplifi platform. You will have access to a profile's public data as long as it's being monitored in your Emplifi platform.

To start using the Connector, you first need to have access to Emplifi Public API.

### How to Access Emplifi Public API

1. Go to Emplifi platform Settings → Integrations & API.
2. If the Emplifi Public API integration is not yet activated, click the Request button - your Account Manager will be automatically notified.
3. If you already have the API integration activated, contact our support team to get your login API credentials. Each user has unique API credentials.

### Login and Authorization

1. Find Emplifi Connector in the Looker Studio Overview (ensure that you are logged in to your Google account).
2. Ensure that you are using the latest version of the connector.
3. Complete the form and click Save.
4. Authorize the Connector. A new window/tab will open requesting you to choose a Google account.
5. Enter the credentials granted by our support team. Your credentials are 'Token' and 'Secret', while the connector will ask for the Username (our 'Token') and Token (our 'Secret'). Click Submit.
6. Set your report parameters (Data Source, pages, option to include Insights, etc.).
7. Click Connect.

**List of metrics and sections not available in the Connector:** Assets API, Community Content.

## Integrate the Public Emplifi API into Your Application

An API (Application Programming Interface) is a way of accessing data and other services between different software programs.

From a customer's point of view, the Emplifi API could be mainly used to retrieve social media metrics from profiles monitored in the customer's Emplifi account to be then used or visualized in another tool or solution. With the API, this process runs automatically.

### What data the Emplifi API can retrieve

The Emplifi API obtains data from the profiles (both public and owned) that you have in your Emplifi account. For public profiles, the API obtains only public data. For owned profiles, the API obtains the private data about insights of the connected social media accounts. For the API to get this data, the owned profiles must have the insight permission connected/not expired.

The Emplifi API cannot provide data for social media accounts that are not added to your Emplifi account as profiles.

### Check your access to the Emplifi API

The Emplifi API is not enabled by default. Emplifi Support enables the API per request.

Steps:
1. Go to Settings -> Integrations & API.
2. If Emplifi Public API is listed under "Integrations in Your Subscription, Connect Them Right Now", the public Emplifi API is enabled.
3. If Emplifi Public API is listed under "Integrations out of Your Subscription, Available for Purchase", click Request next to Emplifi Public API. Your Customer Success Manager gets a notification. Discuss the authorization method with your Customer Success Manager.

### Choose the authorization method

**Basic HTTP authorization using a token and a secret:** Uses a combination of a token and a secret that are separated with a colon and encoded into Base64. Contact Emplifi Support at support@emplifi.io and ask for a token and a secret.

**OAuth 2.0 authorization:** Uses the OAuth 2.0 framework. Contact Emplifi Support to enable OAuth 2.0. Then go to Settings -> Integrations & API -> Custom integrations. Click +Add integration. Enter the name, specify user access, enter the callback URL, and click Create. Copy the client ID and client secret.

## Migrate from the Emplifi/Socialbakers API 1.0 to 3.0

This guide will help you understand the migration from API 1.0 (v1) to 2.0 (v2) and ultimately, 3.0 (v3).

The lists on this page only include metrics that have to be migrated between the API versions. You can find all metrics available in the Emplifi API in the documentation at https://api.emplifi.io/

The guide features tables for individual social media platforms displaying: The old names of metrics (version 1.0), The new names of metrics (3.0), New dimensions (3.0), New sections (3.0).

A whole new set of dimensions has been introduced in the API v2. Previously (v1), the aggregated post metrics were aggregated per day (date.day), but now you can choose between a whole new set.

Content Hub metrics were introduced with v3.

For detailed metric mapping tables for Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, and Pinterest, see the full documentation. Many metrics have been renamed (e.g., comments -> number_of_comments, reactions -> likes). Some metrics have been deprecated.

## Add a User to an Emplifi Account

You can invite new users to your Emplifi account from the main navigation bar by clicking Settings → Users → Add user.

The number of users an account can have is determined by the subscription plan for the account. You can review the limit for your account in Settings → Subscription plan (see [Subscription Plan](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/subscription)).

Steps:
1. From the main navigation bar, click Settings → Users → Add user. The Invite new user form opens.
2. Fill the form with the user's First name, Last name, and Email.
3. Select the Account role and Default profile role for the user (see [Account Roles](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/account-roles) and [Profile Roles](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/profile-roles)).
4. (Optional) Assign the user to a user group (see [Organize Users into User Groups](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/organize-users-into-user-groups)).
5. (Optional) Select Assign all account profiles to this user to give the user access to all the social account profiles in the account. If you do not select this checkbox, you can manually assign account profiles to the user after the invitation sends. The Assign all account profiles to this user checkbox is by default selected if you are adding the user with the "Account Admin" account role.
6. Click Send invitation. An invitation to the account is sent to the email address you specified for the new user. The user is added to the Emplifi account with the status of Pending.

The link in the invitation is valid for 30 days. Once the user accepts the invitation and logs in, the status of Pending is cleared. If the user does not accept the invitation within 30 days, the link expires. You can re-send the invitation with a new link.

## User Roles and Permissions

Setting up user roles and permissions enables smooth and governed usage of the Emplifi platform.

You can select and customize user roles and permissions for secure management and viewability of the modules (such as Dashboard, Unified Analytics, Care, and so on), profiles, and approval workflows.

### Where to find user roles

You can access the user roles and permissions in the Settings section of your Emplifi account, under Roles & permissions.

### Types of user roles

**Account roles** - Account roles control what a user is allowed to do in various modules of the Emplifi platform (such as Publisher, Community, Care, and so on) and whether they can use specific platform functions (for example, manage other users and their user roles, assign labels to content, set up and manage listening queries, and so on). For more information, see [Account Roles](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/account-roles).

**Profile roles** - Profile roles define what a user is allowed to do with the content of individual profiles in the Emplifi account (view content, create and publish content on social media, delete content, and so on) and whether the user is allowed to communicate with customers on social media on behalf of the profiles. For more information, see [Profile Roles](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/profile-roles).

## Organize Users into User Groups

A user group is a collection of users in the Emplifi account. You can organize users into user groups by any criteria: users from the same department, users performing the same tasks, users who need access to the same dashboards, and so on. A user can be included in multiple user groups.

In addition to users, user groups can contain profiles. Adding profiles to a user group allows the users in this user group to see and use the profiles in various modules of the Emplifi platform.

A user group can have business hours assigned. If a user group has business hours, all users included in the group automatically inherit these business hours.

User groups make it easier to: Set up visibility of profiles; Set up visibility of profile labels, content labels, and content label groups; Set up visibility of case views in Care; Assign skills; Share a dashboard; Provide access to answer templates; Assign business hours to users.

### Where to find user groups

## Restrict Users from Accessing Private Insights of a Profile

By default, a user can access data about private insights of the profiles assigned to them. They can see the data through Unified Analytics, Content, and Dashboard.

However, you can restrict the user from accessing private insight data of particular profiles. For example, if you have multiple profiles for your brand across the globe (one profile per location), the user can be assigned to all the brand profiles, but have access to insights of only those profiles that belong to their geographical location.

### What users restricted from accessing private profile insights cannot do

**Unified Analytics:** They cannot select this profile as a data source on a board under Social profiles that contain widgets based on private insight data. They can select this profile on boards that contain only widgets based on public insight data.

**Dashboard:** They cannot select this profile as a data source in a widget that is based on private insight data. However, if someone shares a dashboard with such widgets with them, they can see these widgets.

**Content:** They do not see the Insights section of a content piece published from the profile.

### How to restrict a user from accessing private insight data of a profile

Access to private insight data is controlled via profile roles.

1. Create a custom profile role that restricts access to private insight data (de-select "Give access to private insights" in the Unified Analytics, Dashboard, Content section).
2. Assign this profile role to the user for each profile whose private insight data they should not have access to.

To create a new profile role from scratch: Go to Settings -> Roles & permissions -> Profile roles -> +Add Profile Role. In the Unified Analytics, Dashboard, Content section, de-select the checkbox Give access to private insights.

To assign the profile role: Go to Settings -> Users, find and click the user, click the Profiles tab, find the profile, and in the Profile role column select the profile role that restricts access to private insight data.

## Subscription Plan

In the Subscription Plan section of Settings, you can view the number of profiles, users and swaps (formerly "delete credits") that you have already used as well as how many more you have left.

To be able to access the Subscription Plan section, you must be assigned an account role with the "Access to Subscription plan section" permission (that is, Account Admin or a custom account role with this permission under the Subscription & Billing section).

## Using Sentiment Analysis to Understand Your Audience

Truly understanding your community is a key element when it comes to crafting a content strategy tailored to your audience's needs. Sentiment analysis on the Emplifi platform can help you understand your fanbase, catch possible mishaps before they turn into big issues, and ultimately always make your audiences happy.

### Why use automated sentiment analysis

Emplifi allows you to leverage both manual sentiment tagging and automated sentiment analysis. For brands managing many profiles, automating the process helps scale.

### What automated sentiment analysis does

The Emplifi sentiment analysis is a deep learning/AI-based solution that analyses the text and returns the sentiment of one of the following classes: Positive, Negative, Neutral, No sentiment.

When the sentiment is recognized automatically, the letter "A" is added to the sentiment icon.

### Automated sentiment vs. manual sentiment

Automated sentiment is assigned to Community messages and content gathered in the Content module. You can always manually change any sentiment that was assigned automatically. Manual sentiment has a higher priority than automated sentiment.

### Supported platforms and content types

**Facebook:** Comments on a post, replies to comments, user's posts, direct conversations. Not available for: Page's posts, admin comments.

**Google Business:** Reviews.

**Instagram:** Comments on a post in owned account, direct messages. Not available for: Posts, comments in public account, admin comments.

**LinkedIn:** Comments on a post on owned page. Not available for: Admin comments.

**Reddit:** Posts, comments.

**TikTok:** Comments.

**WhatsApp:** Direct (1-to-1) messages.

**YouTube:** Comments on a video.

**X (formerly Twitter):** Mentions, replies. Not available for: Sent tweets, admin comments.

### Supported languages and analysis accuracy

Automated sentiment analysis is detected for more than 100 languages. Estimated accuracy varies by language (e.g., English: 80.1%, German: 78.7%, Spanish: 74.0%).

### Set up automated sentiment analysis for your Emplifi account

1. Click Settings -> Automation -> Sentiment.
2. Verify that automated sentiment analysis is enabled for your account. If not, contact your Customer Success Manager.
3. With automated sentiment enabled, sentiment is by default automatically applied to all new profiles. To disable for new profiles, de-select "Turn ON Automated sentiment for every new profile that's added to Suite".
4. To disable for a specific profile, toggle the switch in the Status column to OFF for this profile.

### Analyze content sentiment from different angles

**Identify the most positive and most negative content:** Filter search results in the Feed section of the Content module based on sentiment.

**Review aggregated sentiment for an individual post:** Click the content in the Feed section. Hover over the sentiment indicator to see the number of positive to negative comments. Click Comments for a detailed overview.

**Add sentiment analysis data to your dashboard:** Use widgets such as Sentiment of comments, Sentiment of content.

## Personal Locale Setting

You can define your locale details in Settings > Personal settings:

This includes:

- date and time format
