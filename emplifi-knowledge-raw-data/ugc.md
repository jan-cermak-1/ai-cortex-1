## Calendar

After you collect user-generated content (UGC) into one of your UGC [Albums](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/albums), you can use Emplifi [Publisher](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/publisher) to schedule and share the content to your Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Snapchat, X (formerly Twitter), and Youtube accounts.

Due to TikTok API limitations, content collected from TikTok cannot be shared through Emplifi Publisher. This is because Emplifi UGC works with links to the TikTok video file and not the actual video file itself. However, you can still use TikTok content in your widget displays. To learn more, see our [TikTok FAQ](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/tiktok-faq).

Before you can share the content in your UGC albums, complete the following steps:

1. Connect your social profiles to the Emplifi platform:
