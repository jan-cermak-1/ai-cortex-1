## Portal

The Portal is the first place you see when you visit the Emplifi Ratings & Reviews module from [emplifi.io](http://emplifi.io/) or [turnto.com](http://turnto.com/)/ [turnto.eu](http://turnto.eu/).

Whether you moderate content, respond to shoppers, analyze reports, adjust settings, or manage your team, the Portal is designed to help you get your job done quickly and efficiently.

### Portal Layout

Watch the following video or read the contents of this section to learn more about the Emplifi Ratings & Reviews Portal.

[https://vimeo.com/859145428/a3b6e423a6](https://vimeo.com/859145428/a3b6e423a6)

#### Site switcher

The site switcher shows which site you're in, and lets you change sites easily. Your list of sites might include only a production site and test site. Or you might have multiple sites for different geographic regions or for brands within a brand family.

The list of sites available depends on your user permissions. If your user permissions are only set for a single site, the site switcher is inactive and shows your current site.

#### Navigation menu

The navigation menu is available from every page, so you always keep the context of where you're at in the portal.

Menu items vary depending on the user roles you have for the site you've selected. For example, a user with the Moderator role will see moderation pages but will not see most settings pages, whereas a user with the Manager role will see moderation pages as well as all settings pages.

For more detail about permissions and user access, see [Types of User and Expert Roles for Emplifi Ratings & Reviews](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/types-of-user-and-expert-roles-for-emplifi-ratings).

#### Moderation

Reviews moderation includes filters, view options configurable per user, and many other usability features such as click-to-copy.

To learn more, see [Moderate Reviews](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/moderate-reviews).

#### Frequently asked questions

Why doesn't the Questions inbox have a count in the navigation menu?

Navigation counts show global totals that are relevant for every user. Each moderator can set filters that apply to their view of the questions inbox. Those filters are always applied and can be different across moderators. Therefore, a count is not shown on the questions inbox.

Why are there a different number of reviews in the new reviews inbox and the legacy reviews inbox?

The legacy reviews moderation inbox count included all unmoderated reviews within a 90-day rolling window. To access unmoderated reviews that fall outside that window in legacy reviews moderation, you can navigate to All and select the Unreviewed radio button.

The new reviews moderation inbox count includes all unmoderated reviews. By default, new reviews moderation does not include any time constraint. Instead, we have added a date filter. The count shown in the results area reflects the selected time frame. If you want to mimic the legacy reviews moderation inbox, you can use the date picker to only show reviews from the last 90-days.

Watch the following video to see a demonstration of how inbox review counts work:

## Getting Started with Emplifi Ratings & Reviews

Welcome! This guide provides a high-level overview of what it takes to get started with Emplifi Ratings & Reviews.

### Add Emplifi Ratings & Reviews to your website

Steps:

Set up [Data Feeds for Emplifi Ratings & Reviews](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/data-feeds-for-emplifi-ratings-reviews) to add your catalog information into the platform, keep track of new orders, and use your content in other systems. Feeds are the data transfer pipelines that keep your Emplifi Ratings & Reviews implementation running smoothly and help you make the most of your content.

Select an implementation type: widget, API, hybrid, or e-commerce platform. Your implementation type affects installation steps, feed setup, and how configurations are accomplished.

**Widget implementation** — A [SpeedFlex Widget Implementation](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/speedflex-widget-implementation) is the most common implementation route and requires very little coding. Drop our JavaScript snippets onto your pages and let the content roll in. Emplifi makes the theming process simple and easy to follow. We can pull style details directly from your site, and you're able to customize the widgets to match your layout and display preferences. Review our [SpeedFlex Theming Guide](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/speedflex-theming-guide) to see what you can do.

**API implementation** — The [Ratings & Reviews (TurnTo) API Implementation](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/ratings-and-reviews-turnto-api-implementation) is the most flexible option. It's also the least plug-and-play. Because the options are endless, you'll need a set of clear requirements along with the developer resources necessary to bring those requirements to life. Reach out to your Emplifi team, who would be more than happy to help you figure out if this option is right for you.

**Hybrid implementation** — A hybrid option combines widgets and API in a single implementation. Going hybrid makes sense when you want the speed of a widget implementation but have specific requirements best met via our API. For example, you could use the API for a fully-customized display but power your collection forms with SpeedFlex widgets. Discuss your needs with your Emplifi team to see if this option is a good fit.

**E-commerce platform implementation** — Emplifi Ratings & Reviews integrates with [E-commerce Platforms](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/e-commerce-platforms) to enable quick setup with your existing ecommerce site. Follow the instructions for your ecommerce platform's cartridge, app, plugin, or extension.

### Configuration

Steps:

Configure the [Landing Page](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/landing-page). This is a standalone page on your site where shoppers fill out submission forms, and it can act as a backup when a product page is missing.

Configure [Emplifi Ratings & Reviews Emails](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/emplifi-ratings-and-reviews-emails). Emplifi Ratings & Reviews has many features that help you send your customers the right kind of email at the right time. Learn how to set up your email service provider, customize email headers and contents, and work with interactive emails. If you are upgrading from a previous version of Emplifi Ratings & Reviews, ask your Emplifi team to make sure your Auth Key is a 32-character value.

Configure moderation. Emplifi's robust filter engine scans content for problematic words and gibberish. Because word meanings vary, you can allow or hide terms based on your business needs. You can also enable automatic image moderation. Don't forget to create accounts for staff and experts to answer customer questions. To learn more, see [Manage Emplifi Ratings & Reviews Users](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/manage-ratings-and-reviews-users).

Configure reporting. Emplifi offers a powerful set of dashboards that let you view, filter, and export all manner of content collection and engagement metrics. Configure these dashboards, or build your own, along with scheduled email capability, to make reporting available whenever and wherever you need it.

Configure the structured data for your [Search Engine Optimization](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/search-engine-optimization). Search engine optimization efforts give a boost to Emplifi content you display on your site. Make sure you have a structured data strategy ready to maximize your SEO benefits.

Set up Third-party [Integrations](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/integrations). Emplifi Ratings & Reviews integrates with loyalty programs, analytics platforms, and visual marketing systems to enable you to fully leverage your user generated content.

## Ratings & Reviews (TurnTo) API Implementation

### Emplifi Ratings & Reviews (TurnTo) REST API Overview

The REST API for Ratings & Reviews, also known as the TurnTo API, is designed for developers who want to programmatically submit and retrieve Emplifi Ratings & Reviews data.

It provides access to user-generated content as well as product catalog, shopper orders, and other statistical data stored in the Emplifi system from within your own applications.

Our highly flexible API enables our clients to create custom displays and interactions as well as custom experiences for Checkout Comments, Visual Content, Ratings & Reviews, and Q&A.

#### Why use the API?

Emplifi is constantly improving our JavaScript widgets to boost speed, expand functionality, enhance user experience, and increase flexibility. However, nothing provides you with more development flexibility than building your own user interactions. If you need this level of flexibility, Emplifi provides an API for building your own Checkout Comments, Visual Content, Ratings & Reviews, Q&A, and any other interaction you can dream up.

Using the API provides many opportunities to extend the power of the Emplifi Ratings & Reviews platform. Some possible examples:

Native mobile applications

Custom display applications

In-store kiosks

Site-wide search integration

Shopper profile integration

Catalog maintenance

Import/export knowledge base articles

Multi-language display and translation

Updating user and product data in the Emplifi Ratings & Reviews platform

Building a front-end entirely powered by the Emplifi API requires significant development time and resources. Please ensure that you have reviewed the [TurnTo API for Emplifi Ratings & Reviews reference documentation](http://developers.turnto.com/) and discussed using our API with Emplifi Support.

Another option is to deploy a hybrid (widget + API) approach, such as using the API to supplement widget functionality.

#### What data is available in the API?

Here are the types of data that can be retrieved and submitted via the API:

| Data Type | Retrieve | Submit |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| Questions | Yes | Yes |
| Answers | Yes | Yes |
| Replies | Yes | Yes |
| Checkout Comments | Yes | Yes |
| Product Ratings & Reviews | Yes | Yes |
| Knowledgebase Articles | Yes | Yes |
| Customer Orders | Yes | Yes |
| Customer Profiles | Yes | Yes |
| Content Statistics | Yes | N/A |

#### Widget vs. API: Functional Comparison

Although most functionality is available both in widgets and in the API, some functionality is only available in the API.

| Functionality | Widget | API | API Documentation |
|---------------|--------|-----|-------------------|
| Ratings & Reviews | Yes | Yes | [Reviews](http://developers.turnto.com/#reviews) |
| Q&A | Yes | Yes | [Questions](http://developers.turnto.com/#questions) & [Answers](http://developers.turnto.com/#answers) |
| Checkout Comments | Yes | Yes | [Comments](http://developers.turnto.com/#comments) |
| Visual Content | Yes | Yes | [Media](http://developers.turnto.com/#media) or [Reviews](http://developers.turnto.com/#reviews) |
| Star-Only Reviews | No | Yes | [Reviews](http://developers.turnto.com/#reviews) |
| Inline Media Collection | No | Yes | [Media](http://developers.turnto.com/#media) |
| Multiple reviews per shopper per SKU | No | Yes | Not applicable |

Developers can use their custom API-based applications alongside the Emplifi Ratings & Reviews widgets for the same site ID. This is particularly important for sites that use Emplifi Ratings & Reviews widgets on their website and the API for their native mobile apps.

#### Getting Started with the API

To begin building your custom API-based displays and user interactions, you need access to the API and must provide your product catalog and create some orders.

**Primary access token**

Emplifi Ratings & Reviews uses OAuth 2.0 Bearer tokens to control API access. You submit your `client_id` (Site Key) and `client_secret` (Auth Key) to authenticate. The API returns a primary API access token when you are authenticated, which authorizes you to send and retrieve your information with the API.

Best practices

Your `client_secret` (Auth Key) is equivalent to a password and must be protected, preferably by doing the authentication on the server side.

To prevent the possibility of API requests being misused, external clients (such as Native Mobile applications) should take steps to protect and conceal the primary API access token. This could be through the use of a proxy server to make API requests or a trusted server to provide authorization to external clients after deployment.

Steps:

In Emplifi Ratings & Reviews, click Settings → Manage site.

Note your Site Key and Auth Key.

Send a POST request to the `/v1.3/oauth2/token` API endpoint. For details, see [Obtaining the primary access token](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/api-quick-reference) in the API Quick Reference article.

The response includes your access token.

Do not request a new primary API access token each time you call the API. Emplifi Ratings & Reviews does not automatically invalidate the primary access token. Consider using a persistent cache to limit the number of calls for the token. If your security process requires the token be renewed periodically, you can [invalidate the access token](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/api-quick-reference) and request a new one.

**Submitting your product catalog**

We recommend using the [Catalog Feed](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/catalog-feed) for all implementations. However, we also provide API access to your catalog details, as well as the ability to add to and update your catalog items. To submit an item into your product catalog using the API, send a POST request to the `/v1.3/products` endpoint. For details, see [Update Product](http://developers.turnto.com/#products-update-product-post) in the API documentation.

**Capturing your orders**

To enter your order into Emplifi Ratings & Reviews, send a POST request to the `/v1.3/orders/create` endpoint as each order occurs. For details, see [Create Order](http://developers.turnto.com/#orders-create-order-post) in the API documentation.

### Next Steps

Now that you have access to the API, have submitted your product catalog, and have set up order logging, you're ready to move on to using the API to build displays and user interactions.

To learn more about using the API in general and for a complete listing of all endpoints, see the [Ratings & Reviews API reference documentation](http://developers.turnto.com/). For an explanation of frequently used endpoints, see the [API Quick Reference](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/api-quick-reference). Or learn about [Using the API to Build Emplifi Ratings & Reviews](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/using-the-api-to-build-emplifi-ratings-and-reviews) widgets.

## Emplifi Ratings & Reviews Webhooks

Webhooks let you get data from Emplifi Ratings & Reviews when events happen. Webhooks are HTTP callbacks that send real-time data in JSON format. They replace once-daily feed processing with updates that are automatically triggered when content is added or changed. Webhooks can directly integrate with your product information management (PIM) software, ecommerce platforms, or help desk systems.

### Webhooks vs. APIs

Why use a webhook when an API endpoint can provide the same data? An API does something when you ask it to. A webhook does something when an event happens. With API calls, you start the communication. With a webhook, Emplifi starts the communication. It's like the difference between checking your mailbox each day to see if you have received a package (API) versus getting an alert when a postal worker delivers a package (webhook).

### Parts of a webhook implementation

Emplifi has developed webhooks for the "review" entity type.

An event type is a category of actions in the Emplifi system that generates data for an entity. An event is an action.

Event example: A review is published.

A webhook URL (endpoint), is a client-provided, secure destination that accepts HTTP post requests. This is where a Emplifi webhook will send event information.

A subscription is the mechanism that associates Emplifi events with your webhook URL.

You subscribe to events, and Emplifi sends data for that event type to the webhook URL as the events occur.

A webhook payload is a JSON blob delivered to the webhook URL.

### Getting started with webhooks

Decide your security and privacy strategies.

Depending on your security strategy, you may need your Emplifi siteKey, authKey, and bearer token.

See [Security and privacy](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/emplifi-ratings-and-reviews-webhooks#Security-and-privacy) for supported options.

Determine your webhook URL, where Emplifi should deliver the webhook payload.

Work with Emplifi Support to define which events to include in your subscription.

Set up your webhook URL (endpoint) to receive event notifications (JSON Messages) with your security strategy.

Work with Emplifi Support to:

Configure a webhook subscription for your test site

Test and verify the endpoint using your test site

Configure a webhook subscription for your production site

Test and verify the endpoint in production

### Security and privacy

**Privacy**

Emplifi can remove personally identifiable information (PII) before sending data to your webhook URL.

Available PII policies include:

ALLOW_ALL - all PII is included in webhook events

HIDE_EMAIL - email addresses are hidden in webhook events

HIDE_ALL - no PII is included in webhook events

**Security**

Emplifi provides multiple authentication methods to support your security strategy as you set up a webhook URL (endpoint) where you will receive event notifications.

Available authentication strategies include:

NONE - no authorization method included

HTTP BASIC - payload includes HTTP basic authorization header (you provide a user name and password that we'll use to access your URL)

REQUEST SIGNING - a webhook request includes a signature parameter to verify that the sender is Emplifi, by hashing expected values associated with the call. This strategy can be combined with any of the other strategies

BEARER - payload includes site-specific OAuth 2.0 Bearer token authorization header

### Request Signing Hash

With the REQUEST SIGNING authentication method, the query string of a webhook request includes a `ttsign` parameter. This field's value is a URL-encoded HMAC SHA256 hash of a combination of information from the webhook body and your webhook signed with your authkey. You can compute this value yourself to verify the request's authenticity.

The pre-hashed string is an ampersand-separated string. It includes the following fields in the listed order:

Webhook endpoint URL - the full webhook URL (endpoint) you provided Emplifi

Review Title - the title of the review in the payload, found in the `title` field of the entity in the request payload

Review Text - the review text from the `text` field of the entity in the request payload

Rating - the value from the `rating` field of the entity in the request payload

Request Timestamp - the timestamp of the request, found in the `webhookTimestamp` field of the request payload

The example payload below, with a hypothetical webhook-receiving endpoint of `https://www.example.com/turnto_webhooks`, results in the pre-hashed string:

`https://www.example.com/turnto_webhooks&An awesome jacket!&This jacket fits perfectly and looks absolutely amazing.&4&1581368301529`

To verify the request's authenticity:

Hash the string with an HMAC SHA256 hash, using your Emplifi site's authkey as the private key.

Base-64 encode the hash.

Compare the result to the `ttsign` parameter.

### Event types in Emplifi webhooks

| Event Type | Triggered When |
|------------|----------------|
| CREATE | A review has been submitted. |
| PUBLISH | A review has been approved for public display. |
| HIDE | A review has been hidden. |
| DELETE | A review has been deleted. |

| RESPONSE | A review response has been published, hidden or deleted. |
| MEDIA_PUBLISH | A picture or video submitted with a review has been approved for public display. |
| MEDIA_HIDE | A picture or video submitted with a review has been hidden. |

### Webhook payload data fields

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| entity | The entity includes the review id, content, and details. |
| entityType | The type of content in the entity, e.g. 'review'. |
| eventType | The category of the event. (See Event types in Emplifi webhooks, above) |
| affectedKey | The affectedKey identifies the entity type that triggered the webhook. For the entity, the affectedKey is "top". For a nested entity, it is formatted `_`. Example: If your subscription includes published response events, the affectedKey woud be `response__12345`. |
| siteKey | This is the site key from your site's Emplifi configuration page. |
| siteDisplayName | This is the display name from your site's Emplifi configuration page. |
| webhookTimestamp | This is the time when the event was converted to a webhook call. |
| webhookRequestId | The webhookRequestId is made up of: ` __ __ ` (Where the attempt number is 0 on the initial call, 1 on the first call, etc.) |
| webhookVersion | This shows the schema version of the JSON payload. |

### Example webhook payload

If you have a webhook endpoint with a different payload schema, contact Emplifi Support to discuss payload customization. Advanced customization may incur additional costs and an extended timeline for testing and deployment.

## Emplifi Ratings & Reviews Emails

Email is a great way to communicate with your customers. Emplifi Ratings & Reviews has many features that manage these kinds of communications, sending your customers the right kind of email at the right time.

Let's get started!

### Which emails we send

Emplifi Ratings & Reviews sends many kinds of emails to your shoppers and to your internal teams. To learn more, see [Email Types](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/email-types).

### Landing page

When a shopper clicks on a link in an email or taps a star rating, they are brought to your [branded landing page](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/landing-page) to complete the interaction.

Ratings & Reviews Submission forms are now embedded in your branded landing page during implementation. If your site was set up before February 2021, contact Emplifi Support to allow embedded submission forms.

Not all email links bring shoppers to a landing page. To see which ones do, view the list of [Email Types](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/email-types).

### Choosing your email service provider (ESP)

Deciding on your ESP—the company that bulk-sends your email—has a big impact on the process of configuring your email. You can use your own ESP, or allow Emplifi to send the email (we use SendGrid to send customer emails).

To learn more, see [Third-Party ESP Integrations](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/third-party-esp-integrations).

#### Featured ESPs

Emplifi Ratings & Reviews has full integration, including Inbox Submission, with the following Email Service Providers (ESPs):

[Braze](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/braze)

Cordial

SendGrid (Emplifi's ESP)

Excluding Inbox Submission, Emplifi Ratings & Reviews has integrated with the following ESPs:

CheetahMail (Experian)

Dot Mailer

Emarsys

[Listrak](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/listrak)

[Klaviyo](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/klaviyo)

Mandrill

Mapp

Maropost

[Responsys](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/responsys)

[Sailthru](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/sailthru)

[Salesforce Marketing Cloud (SFMC)](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/salesforce-marketing-cloud-sfmc) [ExactTarget]

SparkPost

YesMail

For implementation steps, see the links above or contact your Emplifi Customer Success Manager.

If you are upgrading from a previous version of Emplifi, ask your Solutions Manager to make sure your Emplifi Auth Key is a 32-character value.

### Customizing email headers

When you send an email, you might want the "from" address to appear from your business, even if Emplifi sends it. This is called white labeling. To learn more, see [Sending Emplifi Emails Under Your Domain](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/sending-emplifi-emails-under-your-domain).

It is also possible to send all emails yourself. You can link to our Emplifi Ratings & Reviews widgets using a JSON Web Token (JWT) or collect the data yourself and pass it to us via the API. To explore whether one of these options is right for you, speak with your Emplifi Customer Success Manager.

### Customizing email contents

Emplifi Ratings & Reviews sends emails to your shoppers in a variety of situations, and we also offer ways to customize your message. For example, you'll probably want your company logo at the top of all shopper-facing email communications. Read more about customizing [Email Templates](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/email-templates).

When a shopper clicks on a link in an email or taps a star rating, the shopper is brought to a lightweight landing page with your site's branding. Read more about the [Landing Page](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/landing-page).

### Inbox Submission

Emplifi Ratings & Reviews allows you to reach out to your shoppers with fully interactive forms they can complete inside their email client, no browser required.

There are two products with built-in interactivity inside of email messages:

[Inbox Submission Review Mail](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/inbox-submission-review-mail) allows you to send requests to your shoppers and allow them to write a product review inside of their email client.

[Inbox Submission Question Mail](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/inbox-submission-question-mail) allows you to send shopper questions to other shoppers, and allow them to answer questions directly inside of their email client.

You can also:

Read about ESP support and email client support in [Inbox Submission](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/inbox-submission).

See [Customizing Inbox Submission](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/customizing-inbox-submission) to learn what changes you can make to your Inbox Submission emails and the differences between basic and advanced customizations.

## Syndication

Syndication is when user generated content (UGC) on one site is shared to other sites. Syndication helps brands and retailers share UGC. Products with more user generated content (UGC), like reviews, sell better.

The site where content originates is a Source, and a site that reuses the content is a Recipient. Both the source owners and recipient sites benefit from syndication.

Source owners make content about their products available on multiple sites.

Often the source owner is a brand who supplies content to retailers.

Sources send a full set of published/publishable content; sources do not send any personal data. (See [https://emplifi.io/legal/pixlee-turnto/terms-syndication](https://emplifi.io/legal/pixlee-turnto/terms-syndication).)

Sources can become part of the Emplifi syndication network or give permission to syndicate to a specific recipient.

Sources get access to a dashboard that shows where their content is being shared.

Recipients get to show more content to shoppers on their sites.

Often recipients are retailers who display reviews from brands.

Recipients can apply their moderation policies to syndicated content.

Recipients that use Emplifi can view analytics on their reviews and syndication sources.

### Internal syndication

If both the source and recipient sites are on Emplifi, automatically sharing and managing UGC is easy.

Both the recipient and the source must have live Emplifi production accounts.

Sources and recipients must have common data points available for product matching. (To learn more, see Product matching in [Syndication](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/syndication).)

If you brought syndicated reviews with you when you implemented, talk to Emplifi support before beginning syndication.

Recipients can apply their moderation policies to a source's syndicated content.

Syndication can be one-way or bi-directional.

### Inbound syndication

A source outside of Emplifi can use Open Review Syndication to share content with you.

To participate, sources visit the [https://emplifi.io/ors](https://emplifi.io/ors) page, sign-up, and agree to [https://emplifi.io/legal/pixlee-turnto/terms-syndication](https://emplifi.io/legal/pixlee-turnto/terms-syndication).

To add and update syndicated reviews, sources can set up a data feed to send user generated content (UGC) to Emplifi. A data feed must meet minimum data requirements.

(To learn more, see [Inbound Syndication Feeds](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/inbound-syndication-feeds) for steps).

If a data feed isn't feasible, contact Emplifi support to see what other options are available.

#### Product matching

Syndication requires product matching. Emplifi has a variety of matching strategies, based on exact matching of data elements: Global Trade Item Numbers (GTINs) and/or Brand in combination with Manufacturer Part Number (MPN).

Emplifi recommends internal sources include the following product data points in their catalogs. Inbound sources should provide them through the syndication process:

Brand

MPN

GTIN Common GTINs include Universal Product Code (UPC), which is a 12-digit barcode, and European Article Number (EAN), which is a 13-digit barcode.

#### Matching strategies

GTIN Association: Product matching is based on matching GTINs between the source and recipient catalogs.

Brand + MPN Association: Product matching is based on matching MPN and Brand data between both parties. Emplifi clients' Brand and MPN data come from their Product Catalog.

Combination: When GTINs and/or MPN are sparsely populated from either party, we use a combination of both UPC Association and Brand + MPN Association strategies for product matching.

Other Strategies: Contact Emplifi support to see what other strategies may work for you.

#### Product families

A recipient who wants variations of the same parent product to share syndicated content must structure product families in the Emplifi catalog feed.

Significance: If a source structures their catalog at the parent-product-level, reviews from all variations of the product are tied to the parent-product; for example, the reviews for the small, medium, and large variants of the same product are located on one product page.

Structure product families in Emplifi catalog feed

To group variant products, you can use Virtual Parent Codes (VPC) in an Emplifi catalog feed to create a product family that shares content.

To learn more about how our VPC creates product families, see Virtual parent code (VPC) and members in [Virtual Parent Code (VPC) and Members](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/virtual-parent-code-vpc-and-members).

Product matching is complicated, especially when product families have not been structured in a source catalog. Due to the complexities involved in matching, a variant from a source may syndicate to a different variant on a recipient site. Contact [syndication@emplifi.io](mailto:syndication@emplifi.io) if product matching is not providing expected results.

### Content export

Emplifi clients who want to provide content for syndication to brands or retailers outside the Emplifi syndication network can contact Emplifi support about the options available.

## Search Engine Optimization

Getting your products in front of customers who are looking to buy is a key step in the conversion process. Search engine optimization (SEO) strategies play a major role in product awareness. Emplifi can augment your SEO efforts.

### Structured data

When used well, structured data is a humble but powerful product champion.

[Introduction to Structured Data](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/introduction-to-structured-data) - See how search engines use structured data, and read up on background resources to grow your knowledge of this useful area.

[Working with Structured Data](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/working-with-structured-data) - See what structured data Emplifi generates and how to fit that into your structured data strategy.

[Maintaining Structured Data](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/maintaining-structured-data) - See common issues ecommerce sites encounter with structured data and how to resolve them.

### Speed matters for SEO

Google wants everything on the web to be faster, and gives preference to sites that load quickly. Here's how Emplifi outshines the competition:

Emplifi's product widgets are written using the latest in reactive JavaScript for the fastest and lightest display.

Our JavaScript bundle size is one-half to one-quarter the size of our competitors; it's optimized for speed.

Emplifi's code libraries dynamically generate the minimum amount of code needed for features on a page, lowering the workload on browsers.

### Lots of long-tail keywords

Your customers happen to write product reviews using the same words and phrases that people searching for those products also use. Product reviews embed these long-tail keywords right in your site with little effort on your part. And that means your website and product pages will rank higher in search engine results pages.

### The freshness factor

Search engines love active pages that are frequently updated. Emplifi's products capture more content than the competition with innovations like Inbox Submissions, meaning your product pages will receive more frequent updates with us. That's a signal to search engine web crawlers that your page is important and will boost your SEO as a result.

#### As a Emplifi customer, how do I access personal information in the Emplifi system?

Steps:

Query the TurnTo [User UGC](https://developers.turnto.com/#users-user-ugc-get) API endpoint to determine whether Emplifi has any content created by an individual user. This endpoint can locate user data based on an email address or external ID.

Extract that user generated content.

#### As a Emplifi customer, how do I delete the personal information of my shoppers from the Emplifi system?

If a user or shopper (data subject) has requested to have all their personal information deleted, you can direct Emplifi to delete user data it has stored in one of two ways:

To submit a deletion request using our REST API, send a POST request to the forget user endpoint. For details, see [Forget User](https://developers.turnto.com/#users-forget-user-post) in the TurnTo API for Emplifi Ratings & Reviews documentation. The benefit to using the API is that you can automate the removal of shoppers.

If you expect few deletion requests, you can email support@emplifi.io with authorization to make the deletion. Your request should include:

The data subject's name

The data subject's email address, or an external user ID for them

#### User roles and personal information

We provide [user roles](https://emplifi-docs.atlassian.net/wiki/pages/createpage.action?spaceKey=dp&amp;title=Roles%20and%20Experts&amp;linkCreation=true&amp;fromPageId=696848876) that cannot see shopper email addresses in moderation or content reporting.

Third-Party Moderator - cannot see shopper email addresses in any moderation views, including moderation search.

Third-Party Report Viewer - cannot see shopper email addresses in any content reporting screens or exported report files.

Site Managers can add new users to these roles in the Roles tab in site management.

If a user has both roles, the more restrictive role takes precedence, so the user will not see the shopper email addresses.

### Compatibility

#### Content Security Policy

Modern browsers allow sites to restrict the domains from which content can be loaded through the use of a Content Security Policy (CSP).

## Review Incentives

The Review Incentives section of the portal allows you to offer a promo code incentive when a shopper submits a review. You're able to offer an incentive on submitted reviews or submitted reviews w/ visual content.

### Review Incentives campaigns

We support two types of incentive campaigns:

Static Campaigns are limited to a maximum of 500 SKUs

Dynamic Campaigns don't have a limit and can be narrowed down by filters

If you're interested in trying Review Incentives please contact your Customer Success Manager or Account Manager to learn more.

If Review Incentives is already enabled on your account, you can start creating campaigns by following the [Campaign Management](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/campaign-management) guide.

### Review Incentives email timing

Product SKUs included in a Review Incentives campaign have their own email delivery time frame. We recommend having these emails be sent a little earlier than your normal Review Solicitation Emails.

## Moderate Reviews

After a shopper submits a review to your site, the review and any of its visual content goes to your Inbox in Moderate → Reviews.

### Moderation Overview

To manage the reviews in your site, consider the following key points:

How your site is configured in Settings → Content Settings → Reviews settings determines which reviews in your inbox are Auto published or Auto hidden.

All reviews that contain profanity or that are 25% or more gibberish are automatically hidden.

If there is any visual content attached to the review, our image recognition software evaluates the content for obscenity and determines whether to automatically publish or hide the assets.

Regardless of whether a review is automatically published or automatically hidden, reviews remain in your inbox until a moderator verifies that the correct action was applied to the review. This allows as many reviews as possible to be published while ensuring the ability to find reviews that still need moderation.

When a member of your team selects either Publish or Hide on a review in your inbox, or from anywhere else in Moderate → Reviews, the review is removed from the inbox and transferred to Moderate → Reviews → Moderated. To reset the moderation status of the review and return the review to your inbox, click the current Status → and Reset.

You can find all of the reviews for your site in Moderate → Reviews → All. Items in the All folder include both moderated and unmoderated items. In other words, it is the combination of everything from the Moderated and Inbox areas.

One or more of the following system flags can be added to any review by moderators, and every flagged review can be found in Moderate → Reviews → Flagged:

For CS

Needs response

Inappropriate — Shoppers can also flag a review as inappropriate.

You can publicly Respond to any review and optionally email the response to the reviewer. When responding, you also have the option to hide the response. If you choose to email the response and change the response Status to Hide, the email is still sent, but the response is removed from public view.

#### Gibberish detection

For most languages, Emplifi Ratings & Reviews can evaluate all shopper-submitted text for gibberish (nonsense words). Gibberish is text that might look like words but is just a collection of mixed up characters that you wouldn't find in any dictionary, like "wethl skdjf wer" or "swlkj 34e rlkj". A submission containing real words mixed up in a way that is not meaningful is not considered gibberish, such as "Car their cat bat over fulfilled press photo garden and eventually behind".

The automatic moderation formats gibberish text in the review in an orange color. If 25% or more of a submission's content is gibberish, we automatically hide the review so that moderators can decide if it should be published.

Gibberish detection is not supported for Thai or for [logographic languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logogram)—which rely on a single character to convey a word or a phrase—like Chinese and Japanese. These languages may combine prepositions and other parts of speech with a noun, resulting in an impossibly large set of word combinations:

Chinese (Simplified)

Chinese (Traditional)

Japanese

Korean

Thai

Manual moderation is also required for these languages:

Croatian

Estonian

Latvian

Lithuanian

Hungarian

Serbian

Slovenian

#### Profanity and hide word detection

Emplifi Ratings & Reviews evaluates all shopper-submitted text against the site's Hide Word List in the review settings and our proprietary profanity detection system.

Profanity, or words detected in the hide word list are highlighted within the review, and the review is auto-hidden. Even with profanity or hide words detected, the review can still be published through human moderation.

### Filter and Search Reviews

You can filter and search for specific reviews from any screen while moderating.

#### Filter Reviews

The search filters available depend on your site's configuration. For example, only sites with syndication sources include the Sources search, whereas sites with only native reviews do not display the Sources search. You can add only as many criteria as are available to your site.

Star Ratings

All Reviews — This option is only available for sites that allow shoppers to submit reviews which contain only the star rating.

Tags — Search for reviews that contain specific tags.

### View options

When a moderator is focused on a specific task, such as publishing content, some page elements are not relevant to their task and can be distracting. You can customize what's shown on the page by using the View options menu.

You can toggle the display of the following elements.

On reviews:

Tags

Flags

Subdimensions and shopper profiles

On visual content:

Tags

Flags

When tags or flags are not set to display, you will still see the tags or flags that have already been applied to reviews or visual content items. However, the tag or flag sections will not display on reviews or visual content items that do not have any tags or flags applied.
