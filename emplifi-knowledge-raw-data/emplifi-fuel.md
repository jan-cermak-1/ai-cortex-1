## Command Center layout

The following table describes the layout of the Command Center:

| Section | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **KPI Summaries** | Uses the following four widgets to display summary KPIs from the last 30 days for all connected owned data sources assigned to the user: Number of followers, Total content, Number of engagements, Number of impressions. Each widget indicates the data level (Profile-level or Post-level), the trend vs. previous period. |
| **Objectives & Tactics** | Highlights your top strategic objectives and the most frequently completed tactics. These are the same objectives and tactics defined for your organization in Unified Analytics → Objectives. Clicking an objective opens a detailed view for that objective. The system automatically connects these objectives with live Platform data (posts, impressions, engagements, etc.), and depending on the configuration of each objective, turns strategic goals into daily workflows. |
| **Frequently Visited** | Shortcuts to the most commonly opened parts of the Platform (e.g., Objectives, Feed, Inbox). |
| **Side Panel** | Opens a right-hand panel with a list of unread or historical Platform Notifications. You can configure your notifications in Settings → Notifications. |
