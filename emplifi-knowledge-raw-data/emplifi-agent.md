# Emplifi Agent

Emplifi Agent is a contact center automation solution focusing on business-to-consumer contact.

Agent's product documentation has been migrated to the new documentation site and is available in two versions:

- **Production** - [https://agent-docs.emplifi.io/home/Production/](https://agent-docs.emplifi.io/home/Production/)
- **Training** - [https://agent-docs.emplifi.io/home/Training/](https://agent-docs.emplifi.io/home/Training/)

You can toggle between the two versions at any point on any page.

You can browse the Agent documentation set in the embedded format below or directly.

The old [Emplifi Agent documentation site](https://agenthelp.myastutesolutions.com/Prod/Content/introduction/Welcome_To_Astute_Agent.htm) is still available to ensure a smooth transition. We will inform you about the deprecation schedule in due course.
