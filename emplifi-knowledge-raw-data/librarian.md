# Librarian

Librarian is your AI-powered assistant that helps you answer your questions directly in the selected component of the Emplifi platform.

You can access Librarian directly from Emplifi at any time.

1. Click the Help & support icon.
2. Type your question and wait for Librarian to generate the answer.
3. Move the Librarian window across the workspace window for a better visual reference between the answer and the user interface.

## Best practices

Librarian is an AI tool designed specifically to help with using Emplifi. To get the best out of it:

- **Ask it a specific Emplifi question.** Example: Rather than typing "Emplifi Link", ask it to help you achieve the actual goal "How do I schedule link in bio?".
- **Avoid single-word prompts.** To understand your question, Librarian, as any language-model AI, needs context. If you type in "rule", Librarian will use the Emplifi platform as a context. If you type "Facebook", Librarian will give you an answer but it may be too generic.
- **Give Librarian a chance.** Librarian may give you the answer that you need immediately. Opening a support ticket will delay your answer.

## Get more information

**Related links** - You can quickly navigate to the top-level topical documentation page. Suggested relevant topics will dynamically change based on the history of your clicks.

**Feedback** - Let us know if you found the AI response helpful so we can refine the answers. Fill in the feedback form and let us know what works and what does not.

**Limitations** - Librarian is not a live chat but you can ask it as many questions as you like. At the moment, Librarian only understands English. But it can answer in other languages if you ask it nicely.

## Contact Support

If the Librarian's response and suggested articles do not answer your question, you can open a support ticket directly from the Librarian menu or the Librarian's response window. Enter the following details: subject, description, issue type. Add up to 5 attachments if needed.
