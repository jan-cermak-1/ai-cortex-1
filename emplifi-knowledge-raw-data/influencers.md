## Campaigns

Campaigns are a powerful tool for helping you create and manage Influencer campaigns with the Influencers you have inside your [Contacts](https://docs.emplifi.io/platform/latest/home/contacts) list.

Instead of collecting UGC from your shoppers based on what they decide to share, you can collaborate with Influencers (Creators) through campaigns to collect content for specific campaign albums according to the goals of the campaign.

Some example campaign goals include:

Generating new content

Driving conversions

Building brand awareness
