## What is Trellis?

Trellis is **Sprout Social's proprietary AI Agent**, launched on November 18, 2025, as part of the broader "Sprout AI" platform launch — described as "the company's most significant intelligence update."

**Core function:** Trellis is a conversational agent that leverages Sprout AI to instantly turn **billions of unstructured social data points** into actionable business answers. It transforms social media into an **enterprise-wide intelligence system**.

**Design philosophy:** Move beyond assistive, task-based assistance to a **proactive, enterprise-ready system** that accelerates complex analysis and delivers immediate, strategic insights for better outcomes across product innovation, risk management, competitive intelligence, and more.

## Key Capabilities

### Conversational Data Exploration
- Ask plain-language questions to query billions of data points
- No need to navigate dashboards manually
- Examples:
  - "What are people saying about our competitor this week?"
  - "Why did our brand sentiment drop last month?"
  - "Which topics are gaining traction in our industry?"
  - "Who are the top contributors to our brand conversation?"

### Multi-Step Complex Analysis
Trellis doesn't just answer single questions — it autonomously:
- Explores sentiment across thousands of conversations
- Identifies contributors and detractors
- Surfaces themes and patterns
- Cross-references data from multiple listening topics
- Generates structured summaries with supporting evidence

### Proactive Intelligence Delivery
- Accelerates routine analysis that previously required hours of manual work
- Allows social teams to refocus energy on high-impact strategy and creative execution
- Showcases the ROI of social through AI-generated summaries

### Use Cases
- **Market research**: Query social data for consumer sentiment on any topic
- **Competitive analysis**: Understand competitor share of voice, sentiment, and content strategy
- **VoC for product**: Surface customer feedback relevant to product roadmap decisions
- **Sentiment exploration**: Deep dive into brand sentiment drivers and detractors
- **Crisis detection**: Early identification of sentiment spikes or emerging issues

## Trellis Monitoring Agent in NewsWhip (Feb 2026)

Launched: February 18, 2026 as part of Sprout's "Next Era of Discovery" release.

**What it does:** An always-on agent that:
- Autonomously monitors for emerging stories, sentiment spikes, and reputation risks
- Surfaces early signals on high-stakes content
- Delivers **analyst-quality briefings** — structured, concise, actionable
- Filters out noise; focuses on what actually matters
- Helps teams understand the scale of a story before it escalates
- Suggests messaging that resonates for each situation

**Integration:** Part of NewsWhip by Sprout Social (Sprout acquired NewsWhip in 2024 for media/reputation intelligence).

**Target users:** PR teams, Communications directors, Brand safety teams, Crisis management teams

**Real-world value:**
> "Trellis has provided so much ease in being able to extract a lot of the information that would normally take me so much time and bandwidth." — Bianca Shaw, Head of Social Media & Digital Reputation, Caesars Entertainment

## ChatGPT Integration via MCP

As part of the Sprout AI launch, Sprout deployed a **remote Model Context Protocol (MCP) server** — allowing customers to connect Sprout's social data directly into their ChatGPT workflows.

**What this enables:**
- Embed real-time social data into day-to-day AI workflows
- Instantly analyze campaign performance inside ChatGPT
- Identify top-performing content with social context
- Get actionable recommendations without manual data exports

**Significance:** This is the first major social media platform to expose its data via MCP for LLM consumption — a forward-looking architecture decision that enables "social data as a context layer" for any AI tool.

## Sprout AI Platform (Broader Context)

Trellis is the flagship feature of the "Sprout AI" platform, which includes:

- **Trellis AI Agent**: Conversational social intelligence
- **AI-powered content capabilities**: Optimal Send Times + AI-generated post copy
- **Proactive reputation management**: Agentic capabilities for sentiment spike detection
- **ChatGPT integration**: MCP server for embedding social data in external AI tools
- **Social data foundation**: Premium network partnerships (output generic LLMs can't replicate)

**Key differentiator:** Sprout AI is built on a foundation of social data from premium network partnerships — this means its outputs are grounded in real social signals, not just LLM knowledge. Generic LLMs can't replicate this.

## Comparison with Emplifi

| Capability | Sprout Social | Emplifi |
|-----------|--------------|---------|
| Conversational social intelligence | Trellis AI Agent | Not built (Cortex = prototype) |
| Proactive monitoring agent | Trellis Monitoring Agent | Listening alerts (reactive) |
| Social data in external LLMs | MCP server for ChatGPT | Not built |
| Natural language data Q&A | Available via Trellis | Not built |

**Emplifi opportunity:** A "Trellis for Emplifi" — conversational access to Listening, Community, and Care data — would be a major competitive differentiator. Cortex is the right foundation to build this on.
