## Emplifi Cortex Opportunity

Sprout documents AI by "problem to solve" — a very user-centric approach. Emplifi Cortex demo flows follow the same principle: each flow starts with a specific business pain point and shows how Cortex resolves it.

Key gaps where Emplifi Cortex can out-position Sprout:
1. **Cross-module action execution** — Cortex acts across Publisher + Community + Care + Listening simultaneously; Sprout AI Assist only assists within single modules
2. **Agentic proactive detection** — Cortex proactively surfaces problems and suggests cross-module solutions; Sprout is mostly reactive
3. **Intelligence box pattern** — Cortex's "confirm then execute" UX is more trust-building than pure automation
