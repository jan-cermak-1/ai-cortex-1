## Trend Analysis: What Sprout is Prioritizing

**1. Agentic AI** — Trellis moved from single-feature to full AI agent; Trellis Monitoring Agent adds autonomous proactive monitoring. Sprout is clearly building toward agentic workflows.

**2. High-trust discovery channels** — Expanding deeply into Reddit (subreddit engagement, Listening) and creator content as "answer engines" (Google, ChatGPT, etc.) increasingly cite these sources.

**3. AI platform connectivity** — MCP server for ChatGPT integration signals a direction toward social data as a platform-agnostic context layer, not just data within Sprout's own UI.

**4. Reputation intelligence** — Integration of NewsWhip (media intelligence) with Trellis creates a combined owned/earned media monitoring capability.

**5. Creator economy** — Expanded Snapchat influencer data, Recruit tool, payment options — Sprout is investing heavily in the creator/influencer workflow.
