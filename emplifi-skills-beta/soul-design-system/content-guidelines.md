## Voice & Tone

### Voice (Consistent)

SOUL's voice is the constant personality across all communications:

- **Friendly**: Approachable, warm, human
- **Professional**: Competent, reliable, trustworthy
- **Inclusive**: Welcoming, accessible, respectful
- **Clear**: Simple, direct, understandable
- **Supportive**: Helpful, encouraging, empowering

**Examples of voice**:

- ✅ "This helps you reach more people"
- ❌ "Execute campaign creation workflow"
- ❌ "Amplify user acquisition metrics"

### Tone (Adaptive)

Tone adapts to context and user's emotional state:

**Empathetic**:
- Use when: Errors, failures, problems
- Example: "We couldn't connect to your account. Let's try again."

**Confident**:
- Use when: Success, completion, achievements
- Example: "Your campaign is live and reaching your audience."

**Expert**:
- Use when: Explanations, guidance, education
- Example: "Hashtags help categorize your content and increase discoverability."

**Friendly**:
- Use when: Onboarding, introductions, casual contexts
- Example: "Welcome! Let's get you set up."

**What to avoid**:
- ❌ Fluffy: Over-enthusiastic, excessive praise
- ❌ Jokey: Forced humor, puns, memes
- ❌ Blunt: Harsh, cold, robotic
- ❌ Arrogant: Know-it-all, condescending
- ❌ Bossy: Commanding, demanding

## Grammar Rules

### Sentence Case

Use sentence case (capitalize first word only) for:

---

### Active Voice

Use active voice (subject performs action):

**Examples**:

- ✅ "Min 8 characters"

**Lists**: Parallel structure, consistent punctuation

---

## UX Writing Patterns

**Length**: 1-3 words ideal, max 4 words

---
