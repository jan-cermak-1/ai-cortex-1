# SOUL Design System — Content Guidelines (Voice, Grammar, UX Writing)

> Fetched from https://soul.emplifi.io — Content section

---

## 1. Product voice & style

Our tone of voice underpins Emplifi's mission: helping brands work smarter on social media through automation and AI-powered marketing, while keeping customer success at the heart of everything we do.

### Voice: What Emplifi sounds like

Like every other aspect of design, UX writing centers us around our users — the social media marketers, community managers, analysts, creators, and customer care teams who rely on Emplifi to do their jobs better. We design content that supports clarity, consistency, and confidence across our product ecosystem. Whether users are publishing a post, analyzing campaign performance, managing reviews, or building chatbot flows, our job is to help them move forward without friction — and with full understanding.

Likewise, our tone of voice is designed to support every user interaction. The goal is always to guide our users with compassion and care.

In line with our brand mission, our product voice is guided by these principles:

- **Friendly**: We use a warm and engaging tone—but never at the expense of clarity.
- **Professional**: We're consistent and factually correct, always.
- **Inclusive**: We speak to a wide audience with humanity, respect, and empathy.
- **Clear**: We keep it simple and direct. We don't use jargon or vague language.
- **Supportive**: We guide, assure, and champion users. We're here to help.

As a result, our in-product copy should always be:

- Empowering and inclusive
- Helpful and professional
- Clear and concise
- Easy to read

In short, we sound like a helpful, professional guide—never robotic, never arrogant.

Think of our voice as a calm, knowledgeable companion who's always on the user's side.

### Tone: How we express our voice

Tone helps users feel supported and confident—especially in moments of uncertainty, like when something goes wrong or a task is complex.

But it's not just about sounding "nice." It's about building trust and clearly and carefully guiding users through their journey. Whether we're confirming a successful action, explaining an error, or introducing a new feature, our tone should always reflect the user's context.

Keep the message human, helpful, and to the point.

#### Emplifi's tone of voice

While our voice stays consistent, our tone adapts to the situation.

| We are… | But not… |
|---------|----------|
| Empathetic | Fluffy |
| Friendly | Jokey |
| Authentic | Blunt |
| Confident | Arrogant |
| Expert | Bossy |

### Style: Practical guidelines

**We write to serve, not to sell**

Emplifi is a complex platform that helps people do meaningful work. Our content should never get in the way of that. It should guide, clarify, and support — not decorate or distract. We prioritize our users' needs over internal feature names, marketing language, or team structures. We speak to users in second person ("you"), not about them in third person.

**Write like a human**

A friendly, direct tone helps build trust and encourages action. Emplifi's voice is professional but never robotic. It's confident, clear, and respectful — with just enough warmth to feel human. Use contractions when they help readability. Use natural sentence structure and plain language. Avoid exaggerated or overly technical phrasing.

**Put information where it matters most**

We respect our users' time and cognitive load. That means:

- Making every word earn its place
- Avoiding filler and vague statements
- Leading with the most important detail

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Use plain, accessible language | Use marketing buzzwords or slang |
| Keep sentences short and scannable | Write long blocks of text |
| Avoid jargon, slang, and acronyms | Use creativity at the expense of clarity |
| Use active voice | Use passive voice unless necessary |
| Write like a clear, helpful guide | Sound robotic or overly formal |

These principles ensure users can navigate the platform with confidence and ease.

### TL;DR

- Focus on our users' goals, tasks, and pain points
- Prioritize usefulness over brand messaging
- Lead with what matters most
- Be clear, conversational, concise, and consistent
- Use sentence case
- Avoid jargon, slang, idioms, acronyms, and internal terminology
- Write for a global audience — avoid English colloquialisms

## 2. Soul Content Style Guide

This section outlines how we write for Emplifi products. It provides actionable guidelines for clear, concise, and consistent copy that supports the user experience and reinforces our brand voice.

**Sections:** Voice & style | Grammar usage | UX Writing patterns | Terminology & vocabulary | Soul DS Glossary

---

## 3. Abbreviations

Most of the time, it's best to spell out words when they easily fit within the Emplifi UI. But we do use abbreviations when necessary to keep dashboards, widgets, tooltips and charts short and scannable—especially in areas where space is limited.

- Spell out words when they fit easily in the UI
- Use final period to indicate the word has been abbreviated
- Abbreviate social media platform names, metric terms, dates, and time units when needed
- Abbreviate days and months with their first 3 letters
- Use standard time abbreviations and 2-letter time zones
- Avoid Latin abbreviations like e.g., i.e., and etc.

### Fundamentals

Consider spelling out words when:
- They easily fit within the UI
- The abbreviation could confuse non-native speakers
- The meaning of the abbreviation isn't immediately clear without context

Too many abbreviations together can reduce readability—use them only when they genuinely improve scanning and layout.

#### Punctuation

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| avg., min., Fri., Sep., IG., FB. | avg, min, Fri, Sep, IG, FB |

#### Social media platforms

When space is limited, use common abbreviations for social media platforms. Be consistent across the product.

| Platform | Abbreviation |
|----------|--------------|
| Facebook | FB |
| Instagram | IG |
| TikTok | TT |
| YouTube | YT |
| LinkedIn | LI |
| Pinterest | PI |
| Twitter (X) | X |

---

## 4. Articles

As parts of microcopy (buttons, tab names, feed names, etc.), you can skip the articles, especially if you lack space.

When writing down a whole phrase, use articles.

Make sure you're consistent. If you're not using articles in any button in a feature and suddenly have space for it, don't add it.

---

## 5. Capitalization

We use sentence case so we only capitalize the first word of a piece of text, even in headings and buttons. Avoid random capitalization in the middle of a sentence, for example, when referring to a like, post or page. There are a few terms we capitalize; check out the chapter Terms and Vocabulary for details.

In a nutshell:

- Avoid random capitalization in the middle of a sentence
- Only capitalize the first letter of a sentence, button, headline or subheadline. The main reason for the switch is it improves the readability of the text.

> Hit like, send a comment connect a social media profile

- When referring to the main parts of the Emplifi Platform, capitalize even in the middle of a sentence:

> Dashboard, Analytics, Publisher, Community, Audience, Influencers, Content (Content Hub), Paid

- Respect all brand names that must follow the company's style:

> Facebook, Instagram, Instagram stories, VKontakte

> New Salesforce case, Connect to Facebook

- For the official names of value streams or features, capitalize all the words that form the name except articles (a, an, the), coordinating conjunctions and prepositions (regardless of length).

> Shop Sync, Shop Clerk, Social Care, Emplifi Listening, Salesforce for Emplifi

- If the sentence or line starts with a cipher, it's followed by lowercase.

> 2 content labels have been deleted.

- Dropdown menus start with a capital letter, even if they complete a sentence.

> I want to be notified: {Every now and then/Every hour}

- Capitalize team names

> Design Team, Support Team, Product Marketing Team

### Products/Value streams

For the official names of value streams or features, capitalize all the words that form the name except articles (a, an, the), coordinating conjunctions and prepositions (regardless of length).

If you're not sure about the "officiality" of the name, try to connect the name with the Emplifi. Does it sound official and unique? Capitalize it:

- Emplifi's Shop Clerk
- Emplifi's Shop Sync

### Job positions

When you're referring to a real person together with their name, capitalize the position. When you refer to a job position without being specific, use lowercase:

- Luděk, Director of Design at Socialbakers
- There was a conference organized mostly for directors of design and similar positions.
- Reach out to your customer success manager.

### Titles

Careful, the title is not the same as a headline. Titles are names of books, movies, games, ... and should be written in the title case: Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, One Hundred Years of Solitude.

### File types and extensions

Write file types in all capital letters: GIF, JPEG, DOC, MP4, MOV.

Example: The video formats supported by Facebook are MP4 and …

When, for some reason, you need to write a file's full name including the extension, use lowercase: setup.exe, settings.doc.

---

## 6. Contractions

To keep our voice friendly and informal, we say "we're", not "we are" and "we'll", not "we will".

To ensure better readability, we do not use negative contractions. We always spell "not" fully: It's not possible, you cannot do that, etc.

---

## 7. Date and time

Please note that every user can localize how they see time and date. The following rules are for cases when the time and date cannot be localized for some reason.

### Date

- By default: July 16, 2021 (write dates as "month day, year")
- Friday, July 16, 2021 (if you need to include the day of the week)
- Fri, Jul 16, 2021 (when lacking space)

### Time

- By default, use the 24-hour clock: 12:55 or 9:24 or 10:00 (no zero at the beginning for the morning times)
- If you really need to use 12-hour clock format, use AM and PM: 9:42 AM or 12:43 PM or 10 PM
- When describing a length of time, use abbreviations: 12h 23min.

### Date & time together

When describing the date and time together, start with the date and separate it from the time with a comma: July 16, 2021, 10:35 AM

### Specific time versus ago

- <1 hour: X minutes ago (e.g. 59 minutes ago)
- today: HH:MM (e.g. 12:10)
- past, future: Month, day, time (e.g. Jul 26 12:10)

### Abbreviations

- Month/months: mo/mos
- Minute/minutes: min/mins

---

## 8. Numbers

Write the numbers as a cipher, not a word.

### Numbers

Write numbers as ciphers, not words.

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| There are 2 users in this label group. | There are two users in this label group. |

### Large numbers

When expressing numbers greater than 999 in numerals, use a comma.

The maximum dimension is 30,000 pixels.

Express large and very large numbers in numerals followed by million, billion, etc.

The photo is larger than 80 million pixels, which is the maximum.

### Abbreviations

K (thousand): 10 thousand → 10K engagements (capital K and no space between the cipher and "thousand")

- 14K engagements (don't capitalize the words following the number)
- +5K
- 12K

### Percentages

Use a % sign for percentages: 75%

### Money and currency

$983,209.245

---

## 9. Punctuation

### Periods (Dots)

Only use a period (dot) if the headline is composed of two or more sentences.

Do not use periods when there is only one sentence/phrase in a headline, description, tooltip or snackbar.

There is no period at the end of an item on a select list or drop-down menu, even when it is a full sentence.

### Comma

Skip commas every time it's unnecessary. Don't use Oxford commas when the meaning is clear from the context.

If your list includes longer items and phrases, feel free to use that extra comma — especially if one of the items has an and of its own.

Example: Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter

### Colon

A colon introduces an element or series of elements that illustrates or amplifies the information that preceded the colon and directs you to the information that follows. Think of it as a flashing arrow pointing to the following information.

However, avoid colons. When you feel like using a colon in a sentence, give your phrase one more thought and think of a version that avoids it.

If the first word after a colon is a complete sentence, capitalize it.

When a colon introduces a list of things, don't capitalize the first word after the colon unless it is a proper noun.

Example: Emplifi Platform allows you to manage various social media profiles: Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn and more.

### Semicolon

A semicolon usually joins two independent clauses to signal a close connection.

Avoid semicolons in your writing and split the phrase that might require a semicolon into two.

When writing error messages and offering solutions, a semicolon can be a way to present all the possible solutions in one sentence.

### Ellipses (…)

Ellipsis or … or dot-dot-dot

Ellipsis is one character, and we connect it to the last character or word: Search...

Use Ellipsis in placeholder texts to give instructions.

Examples:
- Select labels…
- Search organic content by profile, label, media type and more…

We also use ellipses for the truncation of long names.

### Ampersand (&)

Ampersand stands for and.

Use it carefully. It attracts attention to usually the least important part of the copy.

We sometimes use & in titles on teasing pages and wordy buttons in Publisher. In other cases, skip them.

Examples:
- [Headline] Your go-to place, again & again
- [Publisher button] Publish, schedule & post

### Slash (/)

Don't use a slash in the product copy. Try to rephrase the text using "or", or find another way of expressing the thought.

---

## 10. Singular versus plural

TLDR: Use plural as a default version, even though it's possible there would be only one item.

When the number of items (such as labels, groups or profiles) isn't clear, try to reword your text and write it in a way both singular and plural can be an option.

No -s in parentheses to indicate both options: label(s), group(s), profile(s)!

If it's crucial to say there might be more than one item, use "one or more".

If you can't find a different way of phrasing it, use the plural. It'll catch less attention than the s in parenthesis.

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| How will you call the label groups? You do not have permission to one or more content labels you've selected. | How will you call your label group(s)? You can't access the content label(s). |

---

## 11. Terms and vocabulary

Check the chart below for word capitalizations and spellings of terms and vocabulary.

(Refer to the live SOUL documentation for the full terms and vocabulary chart.)

---

## 12. Word choices

Wondering whether to "add" or "create" something? Or when to say "remove," "delete," or "disconnect"? This section helps you choose the right word for the right moment—so your content stays consistent, clear, and user-friendly.

### Add vs. Create

- Add an existing user
- Add a profile
- Use add for something that already exists—inside or outside the Emplifi platform

- Create a new post
- Create a new label
- Use create when making something from scratch

### Agent, Client, Customer, User

| Role | Definition |
|------|-------------|
| Agent | A real person using Emplifi products to assist others (e.g. in Care or Community). Note: Sometimes, you may come across the term admin for agents, but we want to avoid this. Use agent whenever relevant. |
| Supervisor | Manages agents and oversees activity. |
| Client | Emplifi's paying customer—the organization that purchased the platform. Internal use only. |
| Customer | A person who interacts with our clients via Emplifi—for example, buying products via Live Advisor or reaching out to support via Care or Community. Depending on the product context, the term "customer" may be interchangeable with "user". |
| User | 1. Someone from a social platform. For example, "Tag Instagram users in the image." 2. Someone from our client's organization using Emplifi. For example, "Add new Emplifi users in Settings". |

Avoid using "client" in product copy. We prefer "user," "customer," or a more specific label when possible.

### Apply vs. Add vs. Assign

- **Apply**: Apply label to content, apply label to label group, apply a label to profile
- **Add**: Add a user to label
- **Assign**: Assign a label to a group, assign a profile to label, assign a profile to a group

To Add profile label means to create a profile label (or content label or a label group)

### Edit or Manage

Use edit when the user directly changes the physical attributes of an element so that it in the end looks different.

When users manage something, the changes are rather contextual than physical, like where an element lives or who's allowed to see it.

### Remove or Delete or Disconnect

In most cases, you'll be considering remove or delete. In some exceptional cases, there might be some other words to choose from.

#### Remove or Delete

When the removal is permanent and can't be reversed, we use delete.

When removing a social profile, we use remove. The user is removing it only from our platform, and they can add it again if they want.

#### Users

When the user is about to remove another user (or another word for such) from the platform, we say Remove user. We never delete users.

However, try to avoid such combinations whenever possible.

- The author of this query set was removed from the platform.
- The author of this query set is no longer a user of the platform.

#### Disconnect

To be as clear as possible, when removing data sources, we disconnect data connections.

### View or See or Show

Use view whenever possible.

Show is acceptable when used as an opposite to hide.

Use see in general, conversational descriptions without a specific call to action.

#### View

Use view whenever possible. This way you're encouraging the marketer to go to a specific page or section for more details, or to reveal more information.

Use view in buttons, calls to action, and link text. It's user-focused, clear, and more widely used than "see" or "show."

#### See

Use the verb "see" in more general, conversational descriptions without a specific call to action.

#### Show

Show is acceptable when used as an opposite to hide. This convention may apply for example when we have collapsible content in an interface or for showing done messages.

Examples:
- Show done messages
- View the post on Facebook (View on Facebook)
- As you can see…

### Log in versus login, log out versus logout, break down versus breakdown, etc.

To log in, log out is a phrasal verb; login, logout is an adjective.

To break down is a verb describing an action that leads to a breakdown, which is a noun.

Examples:
- You'll need login credentials to log in to the app.
- You can break data down by profile or language. The profile breakdown is only available in combination with the language breakdown.

### Sorry, please, unfortunately, and the others

Do not overuse words such as sorry, please and unfortunately. Only use them when the situation is really complicated or requires extra effort from the user.

Compare:
- Please enter your name → Enter your name (as an empty input error message)
- Facebook does not allow third-party apps, like Emplifi, to display this content type. You can still check it directly on Facebook.
- We're having unexpected issues. Please come back in an hour and if the issue continues, contact our support.

---

## 13. Addressing users

you, we, your, my, them, their

### You, your versus my

Address the user as "you" when possible to get them involved in the action.

For example: Select the profiles you want to connect and choose how you'll use them.

When speaking directly to the user, use "your". For example, "find it in your dashboards", "your searches".

Use My to emphasize that the user owns the content, such as My dashboards, My searches. Mostly, my is used for naming a section of the platform.

Avoid mixing your (or you) and my in one sentence.

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Speak directly to the user: You'll find it in your dashboards. | Don't mix my and your in one sentence. You'll find it in My dashboard. |

### They, them, their and theirs

Use "they, them, their and theirs" to keep up with inclusive language. Every time you're not 100% sure about gender, use these to avoid discrimination.

---

## 14. Buttons

Buttons allow users to perform an action or to navigate to another page. In general, they call users' attention to what needs to be done.

Our buttons:
- Have no brackets, no slashes. In case you're not sure about the number, use plural
- Are short and crystal clear
- Use action verbs

When crafting the button's copy, check if the text makes sense after both Would you like to…? (where the product speaks) as well as I would like to… (where the user speaks).

### Button for confirmation modals

If the context or the headline of the flow leaves clear what element (widget, feed, search, etc) the action is referring to, you can omit the name of the element in the button.

It's clear from the headline what the user is saving so there's no need to repeat the word "Search".

### Wizard buttons

We use Next and Finish when setting up something, for example listening or labels, via wizard.

### Buttons for creating and adding items

Structure of creation and addition button:

[plus icon] - [action verb] - [object]

- Create project
- Add profile
- Create Shop Clerk

Do not use "new" in button labels.

### Buttons in Publisher

So far, buttons in Publisher can get more complicated as clicking one button could lead to various results (publishing, scheduling posts or saving posts as a draft all at once).

This is an exception that shouldn't be followed anywhere else!

---

## 15. Email product notifications

Emails are used to notify users about updates in the account and product. They can be used for one major feature or for a cluster of minor features, but it must always focus on a single message.

The anatomy of content in an email:

- **H1 headline**: Product emails always include a main headline that summarizes the main message. The headline should be short but clear enough that the user understands the entire message by reading the headline alone.
- **Subject line**: The subject line should be short and summarize the message.
- **H2 headline**: When an image is included in the email, you may want to include a secondary header. This will usually go under the image.
- **CTA button**: While a button is not necessary, if it is included, each email should only be limited to a single button that is focused on the main message. The button can appear in the middle of the body text, or at the end. For secondary CTAs, use hyperlinks.
- **Body text**: Elaborate on the core message in the body text. You may use relevant hyperlinks. Make the message as short and specific as possible

In general:
- To demonstrate that text should be coded, put the text in {brackets}
- Try to keep the subject line around 40 characters long or less
- Leave out the first name in the intro

---

## 16. Empty states (UX writing)

Empty states arise in situations where there is no data to display in a section of a digital product. Users often encounter empty states when interacting with a product or page for the first time, as well as in cases where data isn't available or has been removed.

Empty states present a basic but unique opportunity to support and enhance the user experience by providing useful information and direction.

The empty states pattern covers the following functions:
- Teasing pages for first-use empty states, including in-line documentation and in-app promotion
- Starter content for first-use states to provide pre-created samples
- Basic empty state for when there is no data, user action confirmations, and error empty states

When crafting text for an empty state, it's essential to consider the specific context. Each function deserves its own distinctive approach.

General aspects of empty states copy to keep in mind:
- If the empty state is shown often, skip the jokes as well - a repeated joke stops being funny after some time.
- A positive empty state can be humorous or playful. But always consider the context; if the situation might be frustrating, there's no place for jokes.
- Keep it short and sweet
- No technical language; no APIs, servers, backends, tokens and so on
- Clarity is a must; inform about what happened and how to resolve it

### Basic empty state by usage

- Error empty states
- User action empty states
- No data empty states

No data empty states can be an opportunity to teach the user about how the app works, while user action and error empty states may present a chance to put a positive spin on the user's potential frustration.

#### No data empty states

Tone of voice:
- Helpful; include facts about what data will populate the page and, if relevant, explain what next steps the user can take to do so
- Positive, but not overly enthusiastic; use exclamation marks sparingly
- Conversational; remember to sound human

We generally use exclamation marks only when encouraging the user to take the first step to populate the page for the first time.

In situations where there are no issues to address and no next steps to take, try to think about what other information could be useful for the user.

#### User action empty states

Tone of voice: User action empty states may be frustrating for users. This is an opportunity to display copy that shows empathy with the user's experience. Use a friendly and supportive tone of voice in these instances.

Always explain to the user why the message is being displayed and offer guidance to help the user take the next productive step.

#### Error empty states

| Error | Explain the situation | Provide the solution |
|-------|------------------------|----------------------|
| No permission | The user doesn't have permission to access the data | Suggest how the user can request access and show who is able to provide it |
| System problem | A problem with the feature's system is stopping the data from being accessed | Guide the user about what steps they can take to learn more about the given problem |
| Configuration issues | A change of configuration may be needed to be able to access the data | Explain the first step the user can take to achieve the required configuration |
| Action not possible | The user's action is not supported by the app. For example, the file size is too large to be uploaded. | Explain what the user can do to overcome the problem. For example, suggest reducing the file to a certain size before reuploading. |

Always support the user by explaining why there is no data, as well as what the user can do to overcome the inaccessible or missing data, or explain what conditions are needed for the data to become accessible.

### Starter content

Starter content should be entirely personalized according to the individual feature.

Planning starter content needs to involve the full product team, in order to establish the most helpful processes and configurations from the user's perspective.

### Teasing pages

We differentiate two types of teasing pages depending on their purpose:
1. First-use teasing page
2. Promotion teasing page

In both cases, the teasing page should provide a detailed overview of the inaccessible page so the user understands more about the feature, and at least one call-to-action to encourage the user to get started.

**Promotion teasing page**: For the main header, pick the single most important benefit of the feature and stay focused on that. Make sure that all headers, sub-headers and buttons include calls-to-action that demonstrate how the user can practically benefit from the feature. Add at least three bullet-points to highlight the main features.

**First-use page**: First-use pages have a similar look and feel to the promotions teasing page, but the text focuses less on highlighting the benefits and more on explaining how the user can get started with the feature.

---

## 17. Error messages

Every error message consists of two pieces of information:

1. Solution to the situation
2. Explanation of what happened

When writing an error message:
- We don't say "Oops!"
- An error message is not a place to be funny
- No technical language, no APIs, servers, backends and so on
- Clarity is a must, inform about what happened and how to resolve it
- Avoid blaming the user or implying user error. Passive voice can be helpful here
- Keep it short
- Avoid sorry and please unless it's really necessary
- Use "Please" only when it requires a lot of effort
- Don't apologize effusively

Examples:
- If something has gone wrong, try publishing the post again.
- It seems the connection to Instagram has been lost. Please, go to Settings and renew it.

---

## 18. First-use pages

A page that quickly explains all the benefits of the feature it represents to clients who've already purchased the feature but haven't used it yet.

For more information, see the First-use page in Empty states.

---

## 19. Headlines

A headline's goal is to quickly and briefly suggest what the rest of the content is going to be about, no matter if it's a whole page, a delete modal or an empty state.

### When crafting headlines

- It's ok to use an ampersand (&) as a part of a title.
- An empty state can be a title as well, that's why they don't end with a period, especially those with an illustration and additional
- Only use periods for abbreviations and for headlines composed of two phrases. In such a case, separate the first phrase by a period (or a semicolon).
- Don't add periods to your headlines. Period, or full-stop is an imaginary break and it might stop the reader from going on to the rest of the text.
- When writing a headline for a teasing page, you can get more creative than in other cases.
- Start with an action verb and use the active voice every time it's possible.
- Keep headlines simple and direct.

---

## 20. Input names and placeholders

A good input name is enough to explain what information should go into the input.

The placeholder text can provide further details about what users can type/choose from but should not be necessary for the user to understand.

---

## 21. Naming product features

Naming helps users understand the product and its functions.

However, always ask yourself if something really needs a name. Sometimes, a mere description is enough and adding a specific name could become friction.

A good product or feature name:
- Does not have negative or weird connotations
- Makes sense when compared to other products, features, websites, or events in the same market
- Fits into the product's information architecture
- Helps users understand what the experience represents

---

## 22. Radio buttons

Use radio buttons when users must pick one clear, mutually exclusive option — and write each option in a way that's quick to understand and easy to compare.

### Writing guidelines

#### Options

Radio button options should be:
- Written in positive terms (what the user does want)
- Parallel in structure (start each option the same way)
- Short and scannable

Avoid:
- Negative phrasing (e.g., Don't notify me)
- Punctuation at the end of options
- Full sentences

#### Introductory labels and text

Start radio groups with a short, clear label or question, depending on context. You can optionally add supporting body text underneath to clarify intent or provide guidance.

- Don't state "Choose only one" — that's implied by the UI
- If using body text, write it as a full sentence and include punctuation
- Don't use end punctuation unless the label is a question
- Use sentence case

**Do:**
- Which platform do you want to analyze? • Facebook • Instagram • TikTok
- Select how you want new posts to be labeled.
- How should we group the metrics? • By profile • By region • By campaign
- Email notifications • All activity • Important updates only • Never

**Don't:**
- Choose one of the following
- TikTok, Instagram, Facebook (inconsistent order)
- How should we group the metrics? • Group by profile • Group them by region • I'd like to group by campaign (inconsistent structure)
- Email notifications • Send everything • Just important stuff • Don't send me anything (negative phrasing)

---

## 23. Selects

Select is an input type we use in forms. It allows users to choose an option from a list.

There's no period at the end of an item on a select list, even though it's a phrase.

Select subcategories are descriptive, don't use action verbs to describe subcategories.
